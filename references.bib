The hippocampus is necessary for spatial learning based on distal landmarks, and it has been suggested that the hippocampal formation performs a form of path integration in updating place cell firing; however, the necessity of the hippocampus for path integration has not been clearly established. Rats with extensive neurotoxin lesions of the hippocampus and control rats were trained on 2 tasks in which they were required to move in total darkness from one location to another and then return to the start point. Hippocampal and control rats both used path integration in solving these tasks and did not differ in terms of the distributions of their arrival points on the return paths. We conclude that neuronal circuits sufficient for computing a homing vector using path integration are located outside the hippocampus.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells show spatially localized activity that can be modulated by both geometric information (e.g., the distances and directions of features in the environment) and nongeometric information (e.g., colors, odors, and possibly behaviors). Nongeometric information may allow the discrimination of different spatial contexts. Understanding how nongeometric (or contextual) information affects hippocampal activity is important in light of proposals that the hippocampus may play a role in constructing a representation of spatial context. We investigated the contextual modulation of place cell activity by recording hippocampal place cells while rats foraged in compound contexts comprising black or white color paired with lemon or vanilla odor. Some cells responded to the color or odor changes alone, but most responded to varying combinations of both. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a heterogeneous input by contextual inputs into the hippocampus. We propose a model of contextual remapping of place cells in which the geometric inputs are selectively activated by subsets of contextual stimuli. Because it appears that different place cells are affected by different subsets of contextual stimuli, the representation of the entire context would require activity at the population level, supporting a role for the hippocampus in constructing a representation of spatial context.},

Building upon demonstrated deficits in neuronal plasticity and spatial memory in FXS, we investigated how spatial information processing is affected in vivo in an FXS mouse model (Fmr1-KO). Healthy hippocampal neurons (so-called place cells) exhibit place-related activity during spatial exploration, and their firing fields tend to remain stable over time. In contrast, we find impaired stability and reduced specificity of Fmr1-KO spatial representations. This is a potential biomarker for the cognitive dysfunction observed in FXS, informative on the ability to integrate sensory information into an abstract representation and successfully retain this conceptual memory. Our results provide key insight into the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive disabilities in FXS and ASD, paving the way for a targeted approach to remedy these.},

abstract = {During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location, head direction, speed, and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal-entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.},

The acuity for horizontal gratings is reliably better than that for vertical gratings, and this difference does not appear to be luminance-dependent.

The acuity of the gerbil continues to increase with luminance into the(human) photopic range, suggesting the existence of a functional cone system.

Classically, upon memory encoding during active behavior, hippocampal activity is dominated by theta oscillations (6-10. Hz). During inactivity, hippocampal neurons burst synchronously, constituting sharp waves, which can propagate to other structures, theoretically supporting memory consolidation. This 'two-stage' model has been updated by new data from high-density electrophysiological recordings in animals that shed light on how information is encoded and exchanged between hippocampus, neocortex and subcortical structures such as the striatum. Cell assemblies (tightly related groups of cells) discharge together and synchronize across brain structures orchestrated by theta, sharp waves and slow oscillations, to encode information. This evolving dynamical schema is key to extending our understanding of memory processes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We evaluated two theories of spatial localization that predict how visual and auditory information are weighted when these signals specify different locations in space. According to one theory (visual capture), the signal that is typically most reliable dominates in a winner-take-all competition, whereas the other theory (maximum-likelihood estimation) proposes that perceptual judgments are based on a weighted average of the sensory signals in proportion to each signal's relative reliability. Our results indicate that both theories are partially correct, in that relative signal reliability significantly altered judgments of spatial location, but these judgments were also characterized by an overall bias to rely on visual over auditory information.

abstract = {Models of face, object, and scene recognition traditionally focus on massively parallel processing of low-level features, with higher-order representations emerging at later processing stages. However, visual perception is tightly coupled to eye movements, which are necessarily sequential. Recently, neurons in entorhinal cortex have been reported with grid cell-like firing in response to eye movements, i.e., in visual space. Following the presumed role of grid cells in vector navigation, we propose a model of recognition memory for familiar faces, objects, and scenes, in which grid cells encode translation vectors between salient stimulus features. A sequence of saccadic eye-movement vectors, moving from one salient feature to the expected location of the next, potentially confirms an initial hypothesis (accumulating evidence toward a threshold) about stimulus identity, based on the relative feature layout (i.e., going beyond recognition of individual features). The model provides an explicit neural mechanism for the long-held view that directed saccades support hypothesis-driven, constructive perception and recognition; is compatible with holistic face processing; and constitutes the first quantitative proposal for a role of grid cells in visual recognition. The variance of grid cell activity along saccade trajectories exhibits 6-fold symmetry across 360 degrees akin to recently reported fMRI data. The model suggests that disconnecting grid cells from occipitotemporal inputs may yield prosopagnosia-like symptoms. The mechanism is robust with regard to partial visual occlusion, can accommodate size and position invariance, and suggests a functional explanation for medial temporal lobe involvement in visual memory for relational information and memory-guided attention.},

abstract = {Feature-selective firing allows networks to produce representations of the external and internal environments. Despite its importance, the mechanisms generating neuronal feature selectivity are incompletely understood. In many cortical microcircuits the integration of two functionally distinct inputs occurs nonlinearly through generation of active dendritic signals that drive burst firing and robust plasticity. To examine the role of this processing in feature selectivity, we recorded CA1 pyramidal neuron membrane potential and local field potential in mice running on a linear treadmill. We found that dendritic plateau potentials were produced by an interaction between properly timed input from entorhinal cortex and hippocampal CA3. These conjunctive signals positively modulated the firing of previously established place fields and rapidly induced new place field formation to produce feature selectivity in CA1 that is a function of both entorhinal cortex and CA3 input. Such selectivity could allow mixed network level representations that support context-dependent spatial maps.},

Place cells can be observed in young rats as soon as they leave their nest at around 2.5 wk of postnatal life. In contrast, the regularly spaced firing of grid cells develops only after weaning, during the fourth week. In the present study, we sought to determine whether place cells are able to integrate self-motion information before maturation of the grid-cell system. Place cells were recorded on a 200-cm linear track while preweaning, post-weaning, and adult rats ran on successive trials from a start wall to a box at the end of a linear track. The position of the start wall was altered in the middle of the trial sequence. When recordings were made in complete darkness, place cells maintained fields at a fixed distance from the start wall regardless of the age of the animal. When lights were on, place fields were determined primarily by external landmarks, except at the very beginning of the track. This shift was observed in both young and adult animals. The results suggest that preweaning rats are able to calculate distances based on information from self-motion before the grid-cell system has matured to its full extent.},

Head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus are anticipatory, so that their firing rate is better correlated with the rat's future head direction than with the present or past head direction. We recorded single-unit activity from head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus of freely moving rats. We measured the time interval by which each individual cell anticipated the rat's future head direction, which we refer to as the cell's anticipatory time interval (ATI). Head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus anticipated the rat's future head direction by an average ATI of {\~{}}17 ms. However, different anterior thalamic cells consistently anticipated the future head direction by different ATIs ranging between 0 and 50 ms. We found that the ATI of an anterior thalamic headdirection cell was correlated with several parameters of the cell's directional tuning function. First, cells with long ATIs sometimes appeared to have two peaks in their directional tuning function, whereas cells with short ATIs always had only one peak. Second, the ATI of a cell was negatively correlated with the cell's peak firing rate, so that cells with longer ATIs fired at a slower rate than cells with shorter ATIs. Third, a cell's ATI was correlated with the width of its directional tuning function, so that cells with longer ATIs had broader tuning widths than cells with shorter ATIs. These relationships between a cell's ATI and its directional tuning parameters could not be accounted for by artifactual broadening of the tuning function, which occurs for ceils that fire in correlation with the future (rather than present) head direction. We found that when the rat's head is turning, the shape of an anterior thalamic headdirection cell's tuning function changes in a systematic way, becoming taller, narrower, and skewed. This systematic change in the shape of the tuning function may be what causes anterior thalamic cells to effectively anticipate the rat's future head direction. We propose a neural circuit mechanism to account for the firing behavior we have observed in our experiments, and we discuss how this circuit might serve as a functional component of a neural system for path integration of the rat's directional heading.},

External space can be internally mapped at different spatial resolutions. However, whether hippocampal spatial coding resolution can rapidly adapt to local features of an environment remains unclear. To explore this possibility, we recorded the firing of hippocampal neurons in mice navigating virtual reality environments, embedding or not local visual cues (virtual 3D objects) in specific locations. Virtual objects enhanced spatial coding resolution in their vicinity with a higher proportion of place cells, smaller place fields, increased spatial selectivity and stability. This effect was highly dynamic upon objects manipulations. Objects also improved temporal coding resolution through improved theta phase precession and theta timescale spike coordination. We propose that the fast adaptation of hippocampal spatial coding resolution to local features of an environment could be relevant for large-scale navigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Accordingly, early neocortical contributions to memory are deemed to reflect a hippocampus-driven online reinstatement of encoding activity. In contrast, we found that learning rapidly engenders an enduring memory engram in the human posterior parietal cortex. We assessed microstructural plasticity via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as well as functional brain activity in an object–location learning task. We detected neocortical plasticity as early as 1 hour after learning and found that it was learning specific, enabled correct recall, and overlapped with memory-related functional activity. These microstructural changes persisted over 12 hours. Our results suggest that new traces can be rapidly encoded into the parietal cortex, challenging views of a slow-learning neocortex.},

In addition, recent theoretical works raise a hypothesis that, taken together, grid cells from all modules maintain a sophisticated representation of position with uniquely large dynamical range, when compared with other known neural codes in the brain.

abstract = {Grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex display strikingly regular firing responses to the animal's position in 2-D space and have been hypothesized to form the neural substrate for dead-reckoning. However, errors accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies, shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration, specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of ∼10-100 meters and ∼1-10 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each other.},

abstract = {Navigation by means of cognitive maps appears to require the hippocampus; hippocampal place cells (PCs) appear to store spatial memories because their discharge is confined to cell-specific places called firing fields (FFs). Experiments with rats manipulated idiothetic and landmark-related information to understand the relationship between PC activity and spatial cognition. Rotating a circular arena in the light caused a discrepancy between these cues. This discrepancy caused most FFs to disappear in both the arena and room reference frames. However, FFs persisted in the rotating arena frame when the discrepancy was reduced by darkness or by a card in the arena. The discrepancy was increased by 'field clamping' the rat in a room-defined FF location by rotations that countered its locomotion. Most FFs dissipated and reappeared an hour or more after the clamp. Place-avoidance experiments showed that navigation uses independent idiothetic and exteroceptive memories. Rats learned to avoid the unmarked footshock region within a circular arena. When acquired on the stable arena in the light, the location of the punishment was learned by using both room and idiothetic cues; extinction in the dark transferred to the following session in the light. If, however, extinction occurred during rotation, only the arena-frame avoidance was extinguished in darkness; the room-defined location was avoided when the lights were turned back on. Idiothetic memory of room-defined avoidance was not formed during rotation in light; regardless of rotation, there was no avoidance when the lights were turned off, but room-frame avoidance reappeared when the lights were turned back on. The place-preference task rewarded visits to an allocentric target location with a randomly dispersed pellet. The resulting behaviour alternated between random pellet searching and target-directed navigation, making it possible to examine PC correlates of these two classes of spatial behaviour. The independence of idiothetic and exteroceptive spatial memories and the disruption of PC firing during rotation suggest that PCs may not be necessary for spatial cognition; this idea can be tested by recordings during the place-avoidance and preference tasks.},

abstract = {Analysis of the neural mechanism of place navigation requires isolation of the landmark dependent allocentric and self-motion related idiothetic orientation modes. To assess their importance, rats were trained on a rotating (360°/min) arena to avoid foot shocks applied in either a room frame defined sector of the arena or an idiothetically defined region of the floor. Independence of the respective allocentric and idiothetic engrams was revealed by simultaneous avoidance of both locations. The possibility that idiothetic orientation was confounded by allocentric intramaze cues was examined in an apparatus consisting of an inner rotating disc surrounded by a stationary belt. As long as the rat was on the moving disc, position of the 60°shock sector was stable on the disk but projected from it to different parts of the belt. When the rat moved to the belt the shock sector was now stable on the belt, but its projection to the disk travelled over its moving surface. The rat always found the shock sector in an idiothetically correct position but the mutual shifts of the disk and belt eliminated the utility of local cues like scent marks for the idiothetic solution of the task. Purely allocentric orientation was required in a place recognition tasks in which pressing a lever mounted on a rotating arena was rewarded only when the operandum moved through an allocentrically defined 60°segment of its trajectory. Place recognition was manifest by increased bar presenting rates on approach to and inside the reward zone. These methods may reveal how hippocampal place cell activity correlates with both allocentric and idiothetic aspects of spatial orientation.},

Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work.

We suggest that the systematic relations between single cell discharge and the activity of neuronal ensembles reflected in local field theta oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs, i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require map representation and are formally identical with learning sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies. In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in 2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest that omnidirectional navigation through the same places (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic memories.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

In the footsteps of these discoveries, many attempts were made to reconcile these seemingly disparate functions. Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.},

However, neural circuits do not depend on human-made instruments but perform computations relative to an internally defined rate-of-change. While neuronal correlations with external measures, such as distance or duration, can be observed in spike rates or other measures of neuronal activity, what matters for the brain is how such activity patterns are utilized by downstream neural observers.

abstract = {Place coding in the hippocampus requires flexible combination of sensory inputs (e.g., environmental and self-motion information) with memory of past events. We show that mouse CA1 hippocampal spatial representations may either be anchored to external landmarks (place memory) or reflect memorized sequences of cell assemblies depending on the behavioral strategy spontaneously selected. These computational modalities correspond to different CA1 dynamical states, as expressed by theta and low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations, when switching from place to sequence memory-based processing. These changes are consistent with a shift from entorhinal to CA3 input dominance on CA1. In mice with a deletion of forebrain NMDA receptors, the ability of place cells to maintain a map based on sequence memory is selectively impaired and oscillatory dynamics are correspondingly altered, suggesting that oscillations contribute to selecting behaviorally appropriate computations in the hippocampus and that NMDA receptors are crucial for this function. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Some accounts predict that environmental sensory information and self-motion are encoded in complementary representations, while other models suggest that both features combine to produce a single coherent representation. Here, we use virtual reality to dissociate visual environmental from physical motion inputs, while recording place and grid cells in mice navigating virtual open arenas. Place cell firing patterns predominantly reflect visual inputs, while grid cell activity reflects a greater influence of physical motion. Thus, even when recorded simultaneously, place and grid cell firing patterns differentially reflect environmental information (or ‘states') and physical self-motion (or ‘transitions'), and need not be mutually coherent.},

abstract = {When walking through space, both dynamic visual information (optic flow) and body-based information (proprioceptive and vestibular) jointly specify the magnitude of distance travelled. While recent evidence has demonstrated the extent to which each of these cues can be used independently, less is known about how they are integrated when simultaneously present. Many studies have shown that sensory information is integrated using a weighted linear sum, yet little is known about whether this holds true for the integration of visual and body-based cues for travelled distance perception. In this study using Virtual Reality technologies, participants first travelled a predefined distance and subsequently matched this distance by adjusting an egocentric, in-depth target. The visual stimulus consisted of a long hallway and was presented in stereo via a head-mounted display. Body-based cues were provided either by walking in a fully tracked free-walking space (Exp. 1) or by being passively moved in a wheelchair (Exp. 2). Travelled distances were provided either through optic flow alone, body-based cues alone or through both cues combined. In the combined condition, visually specified distances were either congruent (1.09) or incongruent (0.7 × or 1.4 ×) with distances specified by body-based cues. Responses reflect a consistent combined effect of both visual and body-based information, with an overall higher influence of body-based cues when walking and a higher influence of visual cues during passive movement. When comparing the results of Experiments 1 and 2, it is clear that both proprioceptive and vestibular cues contribute to travelled distance estimates during walking. These observed results were effectively described using a basic linear weighting model. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The entorhinal cortex is commonly perceived as a major input and output structure of the hippocampal formation, entertaining the role of the nodal point of cortico-hippocampal circuits. Superficial layers receive convergent cortical information, which is relayed to structures in the hippocampus, and hippocampal output reaches deep layers of entorhinal cortex, that project back to the cortex. The finding of the grid cells in all layers and reports on interactions between deep and superficial layers indicate that this rather simplistic perception may be at fault. Therefore, an integrative approach on the entorhinal cortex, that takes into account recent additions to our knowledge database on entorhinal connectivity, is timely. We argue that layers in entorhinal cortex show different functional characteristics most likely not on the basis of strikingly different inputs or outputs, but much more likely on the basis of differences in intrinsic organization, combined with very specific sets of inputs. Here, we aim to summarize recent anatomical data supporting the notion that the traditional description of the entorhinal cortex as a layered input-output structure for the hippocampal formation does not give the deserved credit to what this structure might be contributing to the overall functions of cortico-hippocampal networks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Historically, such cell types were broadly defined by their correspondence to gross features of the nervous system (such as cytoarchitecture). Modern-day neuroscientific techniques, enabling a more nuanced examination of neuronal properties, have illustrated a wealth of heterogeneity within these classical cell types. Here, we review the extent of this within-cell-type heterogeneity in one of the simplest cortical regions of the mammalian brain, the rodent hippocampus. We focus on the mounting evidence that the classical CA3, CA1 and subiculum pyramidal cell types all exhibit prominent and spatially patterned within-cell-type heterogeneity, and suggest these cell types provide a model system for exploring the organization and function of such heterogeneity. Given that the hippocampus is structurally simple and evolutionarily ancient, within-cell-type heterogeneity is likely to be a general and crucial feature of the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {We present a mouse virtual reality (VR) system which restrains head-movements to horizontal rotations, compatible with multi-photon imaging. This system allows expression of the spatial navigation and neuronal firing patterns characteristic of real open arenas (R). Comparing VR to R: place and grid, but not head-direction, cell firing had broader spatial tuning; place, but not grid, cell firing was more directional; theta frequency increased less with running speed, whereas increases in firing rates with running speed and place and grid cells' theta phase precession were similar. These results suggest that the omni-directional place cell firing in R may require local-cues unavailable in VR, and that the scale of grid and place cell firing patterns, and theta frequency, reflect translational motion inferred from both virtual (visual and proprioceptive) and real (vestibular translation and extra-maze) cues. By contrast, firing rates and theta phase precession appear to reflect visual and proprioceptive cues alone.},

abstract = {The ability to recognize information that is incongruous with previous experience is critical for survival. Novelty signals have therefore evolved in the mammalian brain to enhance attention, perception and memory1,2. Although the importance of regions such as the ventral tegmental area3,4 and locus coeruleus5 in broadly signalling novelty is well-established, these diffuse monoaminergic transmitters have yet to be shown to convey specific information on the type of stimuli that drive them. Whether distinct types of novelty, such as contextual and social novelty, are differently processed and routed in the brain is unknown. Here we identify the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) as a novelty hub in the hypothalamus6. The SuM region is unique in that it not only responds broadly to novel stimuli, but also segregates and selectively routes different types of information to discrete cortical targets—the dentate gyrus and CA2 fields of the hippocampus—for the modulation of mnemonic processing. Using a new transgenic mouse line, SuM-Cre, we found that SuM neurons that project to the dentate gyrus are activated by contextual novelty, whereas the SuM–CA2 circuit is preferentially activated by novel social encounters. Circuit-based manipulation showed that divergent novelty channelling in these projections modifies hippocampal contextual or social memory. This content-specific routing of novelty signals represents a previously unknown mechanism that enables the hypothalamus to flexibly modulate select components of cognition.},

abstract = {Spatial judgments and actions are often based on multiple cues. The authors review a multitude of phenomena on the integration of spatial cues in diverse species to consider how nearly optimally animals combine the cues. Under the banner of Bayesian perception, cues are sometimes combined and weighted in a near optimal fashion. In other instances when cues are combined, how optimal the integration is might be unclear. Only 1 cue may be relied on, or cues may seem to compete with one another. The authors attempt to bring some order to the diversity by taking into account the subjective discrepancy in the dictates of multiple cues. When cues are too discrepant, it may be best to rely on 1 cue source. When cues are not too discrepant, it may be advantageous to combine cues. Such a dual principle provides an extended Bayesian framework for understanding the functional reasons for the integration of spatial cues. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Spatial navigation requires the processing of complex, disparate and often ambiguous sensory data. The neurocomputations underpinning this vital ability remain poorly understood. Controversy remains as to whether multimodal sensory information must be combined into a unified representation, consistent with Tolman's "cognitive map", or whether differential activation of independent navigation modules suffice to explain observed navigation behaviour. Here we demonstrate that key neural correlates of spatial navigation in darkness cannot be explained if the path integration system acted independently of boundary (landmark) information. In vivo recordings demonstrate that the rodent head direction (HD) system becomes unstable within three minutes without vision. In contrast, rodents maintain stable place fields and grid fields for over half an hour without vision. Using a simple HD error model, we show analytically that idiothetic path integration (iPI) alone cannot be used to maintain any stable place representation beyond two to three minutes. We then use a measure of place stability based on information theoretic principles to prove that featureless boundaries alone cannot be used to improve localization above chance level. Having shown that neither iPI nor boundaries alone are sufficient, we then address the question of whether their combination is sufficient and - we conjecture - necessary to maintain place stability for prolonged periods without vision. We addressed this question in simulations and robot experiments using a navigation model comprising of a particle filter and boundary map. The model replicates published experimental results on place field and grid field stability without vision, and makes testable predictions including place field splitting and grid field rescaling if the true arena geometry differs from the acquired boundary map. We discuss our findings in light of current theories of animal navigation and neuronal computation, and elaborate on their implications and significance for the design, analysis and interpretation of experiments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cheung et al.},

Interestingly, similar resting-state networks can also be detected in the anesthetized rodent brain, including the default mode-like network. This opens up opportunities for understanding the neurophysiological basis of the rsfMRI signal, the behavioral relevance of the network characteristics, connectomic deficits in diseases and treatment effects on brain connectivity using rodents, particularly transgenic mouse models. In this review, we will provide an overview on the resting-state networks in the rat and mouse brains, the effects of pharmacological agents, brain stimulation, structural connectivity, genetics on these networks, neuroplasticity after behavioral training and applications in models of neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. The influence of anesthesia, strain difference, and physiological variation on the rsfMRI-based connectivity measure will be discussed.},

Currently, approaches to extracting spike times and labels from raw data are time consuming, lack standardization, and involve manual intervention, making it difficult to maintain data provenance and assess the quality of scientific results. Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible.

abstract = {Silicon probes are multisite electrodes used for the electrophysiological recording of large neuronal ensembles. Optoelectronic probes (OEPs) are recent upgrades that allow, in parallel, the delivery of local optical stimuli. The procedures to use these delicate electrodes for chronic experiments in mice are still underdeveloped and typically assume one-time uses. Here, we developed a micro-drive, a support for OEPs optical fibers, and a hat enclosure, which fabrications consist in fitting and fastening together plastic parts made with 3D printers. Excluding two parts, all components and electrodes are relatively simple to recover after the experiments, via the loosening of screws. To prevent the plugging of OEPs laser sources from altering the stability of recordings, the OEPs fibers can be transiently anchored to the hat via the tightening of screws. We test the stability of recordings in the mouse hippocampus under three different conditions: acute head-fixed, chronic head-fixed, and chronic freely moving. Drift in spike waveforms is significantly smaller in chronic compared to acute conditions, with the plugging/ unplugging of head-stage and fiber connectors not affecting much the recording stability. Overall, these tools generate stable recordings of place cell in chronic conditions, and make the recovery and reuse of electrode packages relatively simple.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Closed-loop experiments provide unique insights into brain dynamics and function. To facilitate a wide range of closed-loop experiments, we created an open-source software platform that enables high-performance real-time processing of streaming experimental data. APPROACH We wrote Falcon, a C++ multi-threaded software in which the user can load and execute an arbitrary processing graph. Each node of a Falcon graph is mapped to a single thread and nodes communicate with each other through thread-safe buffers. The framework allows for easy implementation of new processing nodes and data types. Falcon was tested both on a 32-core and a 4-core workstation. Streaming data was read from either a commercial acquisition system (Neuralynx) or the open-source Open Ephys hardware, while closed-loop TTL pulses were generated with a USB module for digital output. We characterized the round-trip latency of our Falcon-based closed-loop system, as well as the specific latency contribution of the software architecture, by testing processing graphs with up to 32 parallel pipelines and eight serial stages. We finally deployed Falcon in a task of real-time detection of population bursts recorded live from the hippocampus of a freely moving rat. MAIN RESULTS On Neuralynx hardware, round-trip latency was well below 1 ms and stable for at least 1 h, while on Open Ephys hardware latencies were below 15 ms. The latency contribution of the software was below 0.5 ms. Round-trip and software latencies were similar on both 32- and 4-core workstations. Falcon was used successfully to detect population bursts online with {\~{}}40 ms average latency. SIGNIFICANCE Falcon is a novel open-source software for closed-loop neuroscience. It has sub-millisecond intrinsic latency and gives the experimenter direct control of CPU resources. We envisage Falcon to be a useful tool to the neuroscientific community for implementing a wide variety of closed-loop experiments, including those requiring use of complex data structures and real-time execution of computationally intensive algorithms, such as population neural decoding/encoding from large cell assemblies.},

abstract = {Mice are the most widely used model species for drug discovery and scientific research. Consequently, it is important to refine laboratory procedures and practices to ensure high standards of welfare and scientific data quality. Recent studies have identified that the standard practice of handling laboratory mice by their tails increases behaviours indicative of anxiety, which can be overcome by handling mice using a tunnel. However, despite clear negative effects on mice's behaviour, tunnel handling has yet to be widely implemented. In this study, we provide the first evidence that tail handling also reduces mice's responses to reward. Anhedonia is a core symptom of clinical depression, and is measured in rodents by assessing how they consume a sucrose solution: depressed mice consume less sucrose and the size of their licking bouts when drinking (their 'lick cluster sizes') also tend to be smaller. We found that tail handled mice showed more anhedonic responses in both measures compared to tunnel handled mice, indicative of a decreased responsiveness to reward and potentially a more depressive-like state. Our findings have significant implications for the welfare of laboratory mice as well as the design and interpretation of scientific studies, particularly those investigating or involving reward. Laboratory environments can negatively impact on the behaviour, physiology, health and welfare of animals 1–4 and considerable effort is made to regulate and improve the welfare of animals used in research laboratories around the world 5,6 . Mice are the most widely used species in biomedical research globally; in 2016 they were used in 73{\%} of all procedures in the UK alone 7 . Consequently, understanding the experiences of mice used in research is of significant importance in order to be able to provide evidence-based improvements to housing and husbandry that will bring welfare benefits to a large number of animals, and ensure that empirical findings are robust 3,8 . Much early work examined the housing in which mice are kept. This revealed that small cage sizes, lack of environmental enrichment, room temperatures and isolation can all negatively impact on mouse welfare, pro-ducing measurable changes in behaviour, physiology or affective state 9–12 . However, more recently, it has been proposed that the handling technique used by researchers and laboratory staff influences both the welfare of mice, and the data obtained from behavioural studies 13–16 . The standard practice of handling laboratory mice using their tails has been shown to increase anxiety compared to being handled with a tunnel or by cupping mice on the open hand 13–15 : tunnel handled mice spend more time voluntarily interacting with a handler, and show less anxiety-related behaviour in standardised behavioural tests of anxiety such as the elevated plus maze 13–15 . In addition, tail handling can reduce performance in cognitive tests, for example it has been shown to reduce the engagement of mice with a novel mouse odour in a habituation task, resulting in the impairment of the subse-quent dishabituation test 15 . However, despite the evidence that tail handling can impair welfare and scientific data collection, it remains the main method used to handle mice and other more refined methods such as tunnel handling have yet to be widely implemented across research institutions. Here, we extend previous work on handling methods to test if being handled by the tail or with a tunnel can affect the hedonic responses of mice towards a rewarding stimulus. Whilst previous studies investigating the effects of handling method on mouse welfare have measured the animals' behaviour towards aversive experiences or punishments (such as being picked up by a handler or being placed in a novel test environment 13–15},

Interference is a byproduct of the need to balance the formation of well-differentiated representations against the ability to retrieve memories from cues that are not identical to the original experience. How the brain accomplishes this has remained elusive. Here we review how insights can be gained from studies of an apparently unrelated phenomenon in the rodent brain - remapping in hippocampal place cells. Remapping refers to the formation of distinct representations in populations of place cells after minor changes in inputs to the hippocampus. Remapping might reflect processes involved generally in decorrelation of overlapping signals. These processes might be crucial for storing large numbers of similar experiences with only minimal interference. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand what a rodent (Meriones unguiculatus) learns about the geometrical relations between a goal and nearby visual landmarks and how it uses this information to reach a goal. Gerbils were trained to find sunflower seeds on the floor of a light-tight, black painted room illuminated by a single light bulb hung from the ceiling. The position of the seed on the floor was specified by an array of one or more landmarks. Once training was complete, we recorded where the gerbils searched when landmarks were present but the seed was absent. In such tests, gerbils were confronted either with the array of landmarks to which they were accustomed or with a transformation of this array. Animals searched in the appropriate spot when trained to find seeds placed in a constant direction and at a constant distance from a single cylindrical landmark. Since gerbils look in one spot and not in a circle centred on the landmark, the direction between landmark and goal must be supplied by cues external to the landmark array. Distance, on the other hand, must be measured with respect to the landmark. Tests in which the size of the landmark was altered from that used in training suggest that distance is not learned solely in terms of the apparent size of the landmark as seen from the goal. Gerbils can still reach a goal defined by an array of landmarks when the room light is extinguished during their approach. This ability implies that they have already planned a trajectory to the goal before the room is darkened. In order to compute such a trajectory, their internal representation of landmarks and goal needs to contain information about the distances and bearings between landmarks and goal. For planning trajectories, each landmark of an array can be used separately from the others. Gerbils trained to a goal specified by an array of several landmarks were tested with one or more of the landmarks removed or with the array expanded. They then searched as though they had computed an independent trajectory for each landmark. For instance, gerbils trained with an array of two landmarks were tested with the distance between two landmarks doubled. The animals then searched for seeds in two positions, which were at the correct distance and in the right direction from each landmark.},

The network we derive incorporates representation and updating of position into a single layer of neurons, eliminating the need for a large external control population, and without making use of multiplicative synapses. An efficient and biologically plausible control mechanism results directly from applying the principles of the NEF.

abstract = {Previous work has shown that the angular position of hippocampal place cell firing fields is accurately controlled by the position of a single white cue card attached to the wall of a recording cylinder: when the card is rotated, fields rotate equally. In this study, we asked whether similar control could be exerted by three-dimensional objects placed directly in the recording arena. In each of several conditions, the locations of the objects relative to each other and their distances from the cylinder wall were fixed. In Experiment 1, the objects were all near the center of the cylinder. In this condition, the angular position of firing fields could, in general, not be predicted from the angular position of the object set. When a white wall card was added to the object arrangement, the stimulus ensemble exerted nearly ideal control over angular firing position. Nevertheless, when the card was withdrawn, the objects still did not control field position. In Experiment 2, place cells were recorded in the presence of two new arrangements of the same objects used in Experiment 1. In the "clustered objects" condition, the objects were placed next to each other, 10 cm from the wall. In the "objects-at-periphery" condition, the objects were put against the cylinder wall by equally increasing the distances among the objects. In both conditions, we found virtually ideal control by the objects over angular field position. These results indicate that the failure of stimulus control in Experiment 1 must be attributable to the arrangement of the objects and not to the nature of the objects themselves. Overall, the results are in line with behavioral studies that show that it is very difficult to teach rats to locate food relative to landmarks inside the behavioral arena.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) experimental behavior setups enable cognitive neuroscientists to study the integration of visual depth cues and self-motion cues into a single percept of three-dimensional space.  Rodents can navigate a virtual environment by running on a spherical treadmill, but simulating locomotion in this way can both bias and suppress the frequency of their behaviors as well as introduce vestibulomotor and vestibulovisual sensory conflict during locomotion. Updating the virtual environment via the subject's own freely-moving head movements solves both the naturalistic behavior bias and vestibular conflict issues.  In this thesis, I review elements of self-motion and 3D scene perception that contribute to a sense of immersion in virtual environments and suggest a freely-moving CAVE system as a VR solution for low-artifact neuroscience experiments.  The manuscripts describing the 3D graphics Python package and the virtual reality setup are included.  In this freely-moving CAVE VR setup, freely-moving rats demonstrate immersion in virtual environments by displaying height aversion to virtual cliffs, exploration preference of virtual objects, and spontaneously modify their locomotion trajectories near virtual walls. These experiments help bridge the classic behavior and virtual reality literature by showing that rats display similar behaviors to virtual environment features without training.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to represent nonspatial information in the context of spatial information. An animal can derive both spatial information as well as nonspatial information from the objects (landmarks) it encounters as it moves around in an environment. In this article, correlates of both object-derived spatial as well as nonspatial information in the hippocampus of rats foraging in the presence of objects are demonstrated. A new form of CA1 place cells, called landmark-vector cells, that encode spatial locations as a vector relationship to local landmarks is described. Such landmark vector relationships can be dynamically encoded. Of the 26 CA1 neurons that developed new fields in the course of a day's recording sessions, in eight cases, the new fields were located at a similar distance and direction from a landmark as the initial field was located relative to a different landmark. In addition, object-location memory in the hippocampus is also described. When objects were removed from an environment or moved to new locations, a small number of neurons in CA1 and CA3 increased firing at the locations where the objects used to be. In some neurons, this increase occurred only in one location, indicating object + place conjunctive memory; in other neurons, the increase in firing was seen at multiple locations where an object used to be. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the spatially restricted firing of hippocampal neurons encode multiple types of information regarding the relationship between an animal's location and the location of objects in its environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Learning critically depends on the ability to rapidly form and store non-overlapping representations of the external world. In line with their postulated role in episodic memory, hippocampal place cells can undergo a rapid reorganization of their firing fields upon contextual manipulations. To explore the mechanisms underlying such global remapping, we juxtacellularly stimulated 42 hippocampal neurons in freely moving mice during spatial exploration. We found that evoking spike trains in silent neurons was sufficient for creating place fields, while in place cells, juxtacellular stimulation induced a rapid remapping of their place fields to the stimulus location. The occurrence of complex spikes was most predictive of place field plasticity. Our data thus indicate that plasticity-inducing stimuli are able to rapidly bias place cell activity, simultaneously suppressing existing place fields. We propose that such competitive place field dynamics could support the orthogonalization of the hippocampal map during global remapping. Place cells can serve as a readout of hippocampal memory. Diamantaki et al. show that the activity of single place cells can be rapidly modified by single-cell stimulation in freely moving mice. This finding provides insights into the cellular mechanisms that support the rapid reorganization of hippocampal place maps.},

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples - at minimum cholinergic activity - coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity - at high cholinergic and theta activity - might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.},

abstract = {Place cell activity in the hippocampus depends in a complex way on the information from two major sensory sources: External (e.g., visual) cues and internal cues (self-motion, vestibular cues). Dissociation of the two inputs in the presence of the animal modifies the place fields in ways that depend on the magnitude of the difference: If the mismatch is small, place fields typically follow the external cues, but if the mismatch is large, their activity is determined mainly by the internal cues. The dynamics underlying the interaction between the external and internal cues in the hippocampus is not completely known, but is an important issue in understanding the hippocampus' role in spatial learning and navigation. In this paper, we propose an attractor model of the hippocampus which captures the interaction between external and internal sensory inputs to the hippocampus. The proposed mechanism accounts for the difference seen in the experimental results in the case of a small versus a large discrepancy between the visual and idiothetic information. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We find that a long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD) from parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the hippocampal area Cornu Ammonis 2 (CA2) is absent in young mice but emerges at the end of adolescence. We demonstrate that the maturation of both the perineuronal net (PNN) and signaling through ErbB4 is required for this plasticity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that social recognition memory displays the same age dependence as iLTD and is impaired by targeted degradation of the PNN or iLTD blockade in area CA2. Our data reveal an unusual developmental rule for plasticity at the PV+ interneuron transmission in area CA2 and indicate that this plasticity is involved in the emergence of higher cognitive function, such as social memory formation, in late adolescence.},

abstract = {Both episodic memory and spatial navigation require temporal encoding of the relationships between events or locations. In a linear maze, ordered spatial distances between sequential locations were represented by the temporal relations of hippocampal place cell pairs within cycles of theta oscillation in a compressed manner. Such correlations could arise due to spike "phase precession" of independent neurons driven by common theta pacemaker or as a result of temporal coordination among specific hippocampal cell assemblies. We found that temporal correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across cell assemblies in place sequence representation. CA1 and CA3 ensembles, identifying spatial locations, were active preferentially on opposite phases of theta cycles. These observations suggest that interleaving CA3 neuronal sequences bind CA1 assemblies representing overlapping past, present, and future locations into single episodes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

At the neuronal level, reactivation of awake experience in the hippocampus during sharp-wave ripple events, characteristic of slow-wave sleep, has been proposed as a neural mechanism for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. However, a causal relation between sleep reactivation and memory consolidation has not been established. Here we show that disrupting neuronal activity during ripple events impairs spatial learning. We trained rats daily in two identical spatial navigation tasks followed each by a 1-hour rest period. After one of the tasks, stimulation of hippocampal afferents selectively disrupted neuronal activity associated with ripple events without changing the sleep-wake structure. Rats learned the control task significantly faster than the task followed by rest stimulation, indicating that interfering with hippocampal processing during sleep led to decreased learning.},

Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual-haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position1-3, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics4-7. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation8-15 to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we first measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual-haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation.},

We review the current literature on path integration and its interaction with external, location-based cues. Special importance is given to the correlation between observable behavior and the activity pattern of particular neural cell populations that implement the internal representation of space.

abstract = {Estimates of location or orientation can be constructed solely from sensory information representing environmental cues. In unfamiliar or sensory-poor environments, these estimates can also be maintained and updated by integrating self-motion information. However, the accumulation of error dictates that updated representations of heading direction and location become progressively less reliable over time, and must be corrected by environmental sensory inputs when available. Anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence indicates that angular and translational path integration contributes to the firing of head direction cells and grid cells. We discuss how sensory inputs may be combined with self-motion information in the firing patterns of these cells. For head direction cells, direct projections from egocentric sensory representations of distal cues can help to correct cumulative errors. Grid cells may benefit from sensory inputs via boundary vector cells and place cells. However, the allocentric code of boundary vector cells and place cells requires consistent head-direction information in order to translate the sensory signal of egocentric boundary distance into allocentric boundary vector cell firing, suggesting that the different spatial representations found in and around the hippocampal formation are interdependent. We conclude that, rather than representing pure path integration, the firing of head-direction cells and grid cells reflects the interface between self-motion and environmental sensory information. Together with place cells and boundary vector cells they can support a coherent unitary representation of space based on both environmental sensory inputs and path integration signals.

The respective contribution of landmark and path-integration to place-cell activity in the hippocampus is still unclear and complicated by the fact that the two mechanisms usually overlap. To bias spatial mechanisms toward landmark or path-integration, we use a treadmill equipped with a long belt on which male mice run sequentially through a zone enriched and a zone impoverished in visual-tactile cues. We show that inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which is known to disrupt the periodic activity of grid cells, impairs mice ability to anticipate the delivery of a reward in the cue-impoverished zone and transiently alter the spatial configuration of place fields in the cue-impoverished zone selectively: following MS inactivation, place fields in the cue-impoverished zone progressively shift backward and stabilize near the cues, resulting in the contraction of the spatial representation around cues; following MS recovery, the initial spatial representation is progressively restored. Furthermore, we found that place fields in the cue-rich and cue-impoverished zones are preferentially generated by cells from the deep and superficial sublayers of CA1, respectively. These findings demonstrate with mechanistic insights the contribution of MS to the spread of spatial representations in cue-impoverished zones, and indicate a segregation of landmark-based and path-integration-assisted spatial mechanisms into deep and superficial CA1, respectively.},

The electrodes are controlled remotely, avoiding the need to disturb the animal during electrode positioning. The microdrive is approximately 6 mm in diameter, 17 mm high and weighs only 1.5 g, including the headstage preamplifier. Use of the motorized microdrive has produced a ten-fold increase in our data yield compared to those experiments done using a manually operated drive. In addition, we are able to record from multiple single neurons in the behaving animal with signal quality comparable to that seen in a head-fixed anesthetized animal.

The discharge of place cells is confined with remarkable precision to a cell-specific part of the environment called the cell's ''firing field.'' We demon-strate here that firing is not nearly as reliable in the time domain as in the positional domain. Discharge during passes through the firing field was compared with a model with Poisson variance of the location-specific firing determined by the time-averaged positional firing rate distribution. Place cells characteristically fire too little or too much compared with expectations from the random model. This fundamental property of place cells is referred to as ''excess firing vari-ance'' and has three main implications: (i) Place cell discharge is not only driven by the summation of many small, asynchro-nous excitatory synaptic inputs. (ii) Place cell discharge may encode a signal in addition to the current head location. (iii) The excess firing variance helps explain why the errors in computing the rat's position from the simultaneous activity of many place cells are large.},

abstract = {The proximodistal axis is considered a major organizational principle of the hippocampus. At the interface between the hippocampus and other brain structures, CA2 apparently breaks this rule. The region is involved in social, temporal, and contextual memory function, but mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we reveal cell-type heterogeneity and a characteristic expression gradient of the transcription factor Sox5 within CA2 in the rat. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings followed by neurochemical identification of single cells, we find marked proximodistal trends of synaptic activity, subthreshold membrane potentials, and phase-locked firing coupled to theta and gamma oscillations. Phase-shifting membrane potentials and opposite proximodistal correlations with theta sinks and sources at different layers support influences from different current generators. CA2 oscillatory activity and place coding of rats running in a linear maze reflect proximodistal state-dependent trends. We suggest that the structure and function of CA2 are distributed along the proximodistal hippocampal axis.},

abstract = {Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have been hypothesized as a mechanism for memory consolidation and action planning. The duration of ripples shows a skewed distribution with a minority of long-duration events. We discovered that long-duration ripples are increased in situations demanding memory in rats. Prolongation of spontaneously occurring ripples by optogenetic stimulation, but not randomly induced ripples, increased memory during maze learning. The neuronal content of randomly induced ripples was similar to short-duration spontaneous ripples and contained little spatial information. The spike content of the optogenetically prolonged ripples was biased by the ongoing, naturally initiated neuronal sequences. Prolonged ripples recruited new neurons that represented either arm of the maze. Long-duration hippocampal SPW-Rs replaying large parts of planned routes are critical for memory.},

abstract = {Integration of multiple sensory cues is essential for precise and accurate perception and behavioral performance, yet the reliability of sensory signals can vary across modalities and viewing conditions. Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neural probes designed for extracellular recording of brain electrical activity are traditionally implanted with an insertion speed between 1 µm/s and 1 mm/s into the brain tissue. Although the physical effects of insertion speed on the tissue are well studied, there is a lack of research investigating how the quality of the acquired electrophysiological signal depends on the speed of probe insertion. In this study, we used four different insertion speeds (0.002 mm/s, 0.02 mm/s, 0.1 mm/s, 1 mm/s) to implant high-density silicon probes into deep layers of the somatosensory cortex of ketamine/xylazine anesthetized rats. After implantation, various qualitative and quantitative properties of the recorded cortical activity were compared across different speeds in an acute manner. Our results demonstrate that after the slowest insertion both the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of separable single units were significantly higher compared with those measured after inserting probes at faster speeds. Furthermore, the amplitude of recorded spikes as well as the quality of single unit clusters showed similar speed-dependent differences. Post hoc quantification of the neuronal density around the probe track showed a significantly higher number of NeuN-labelled cells after the slowest insertion compared with the fastest insertion. Our findings suggest that advancing rigid probes slowly ({\~{}}1 µm/s) into the brain tissue might result in less tissue damage, and thus in neuronal recordings of improved quality compared with measurements obtained after inserting probes with higher speeds.},

abstract = {The convergence of internal path integration with sensory information from external landmarks generates a cognitive spatial map in the hippocampus. We have recorded the activity of cells in CA1 during a virtual navigation task to examine how mice represent, recognize and employ sparse olfactory landmarks to estimate their location. We observe that the presence of odor landmarks at multiple locations in a virtual environment greatly enriches the place cell representation and dramatically improves navigation. Presentation of the same odor at different locations generates distinct place cell representations, indicating that path integration can disambiguate two identical cues on the basis of location. The enhanced place cell representation at one cue location led to the formation of place cells at locations beyond that cue and, ultimately recognition of a second odor cue as a distinct landmark. This suggests an iterative mechanism for extending place cell representations into unknown territory. These results reveal how odor cues can serve as landmarks to guide navigation and suggest a model to explain how the convergence of landmarks and path integration participates in an iterative process that generates a cognitive spatial map.},

abstract = {A fundamental property of many associative memory networks is the ability to decorrelate overlapping input patterns before information is stored. In the hippocampus, this neuronal pattern separation is expressed as the tendency of ensembles of place cells to undergo extensive 'remapping' in response to changes in the sensory or motivational inputs to the hippocampus. Remapping is expressed under some conditions as a change of firing rates in the presence of a stable place code ('rate remapping'), and under other conditions as a complete reorganization of the hippocampal place code in which both place and rate of firing take statistically independent values ('global remapping'). Here we show that the nature of hippocampal remapping can be predicted by ensemble dynamics in place-selective grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Whereas rate remapping is associated with stable grid fields, global remapping is always accompanied by a coordinate shift in the firing vertices of the grid cells. Grid fields of co-localized medial entorhinal cortex cells move and rotate in concert during this realignment. In contrast to the multiple environment-specific representations coded by place cells in the hippocampus, local ensembles of grid cells thus maintain a constant spatial phase structure, allowing position to be represented and updated by the same translation mechanism in all environments encountered by the animal. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

We used a virtual reality setup that offers a controlled environment for sensory testing to quantitatively investigate visually guided behavior for achromatic and chromatic stimuli in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). In two-alternative forced choice tasks, animals had to select target stimuli based on relative intensity or color with respect to a contextual reference. Behavioral performance was characterized using psychometric analysis and probabilistic choice modeling. The analyses revealed that the gerbils learned to make decisions that required judging stimuli in relation to their visual context. Stimuli were successfully recognized down to Weber contrasts as low as 0.1. These results suggest that Mongolian gerbils have the perceptual capacity for brightness and color constancy.},

abstract = {Driven either by external landmarks or by internal dynamics, hippocampal neurons form sequences of cell assemblies. The coordinated firing of these active cells is organized by the prominent "theta" oscillations in the local field potential (LFP): place cells discharge at progressively earlier theta phases as the rat crosses the respective place field ("phase precession"). The faster oscillation frequency of active neurons and the slower theta LFP, underlying phase precession, creates a paradox. Howcan faster oscillating neurons comprise a slower population oscillation, as reflected by the LFP? We built a mathematical-model that allowed us to calculate the population activity analytically from experimentally derived parameters of the single neuron oscillation frequency, firing field size (duration), and the relationship between within-theta delays of place cell pairs and their distance representations ("compression"). The appropriate combination of these parameters generated a constant frequency population rhythm along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, while allowing individual neurons to vary their oscillation frequency and field size. Our results suggest that the faster-than-theta oscillations of pyramidal cells are inherent and that phase precession is a result of the coordinated activity of temporally shifted cell assemblies, relative to the population activity, reflected by the LFP.},

'Sleep replay', the active potentiation of relevant synaptic connections via reactivation of patterns of network activity that occurred during previous experience, has received considerable attention. Alternatively, sleep has been suggested to regulate synaptic weights homeostatically and nonspecifically, thereby improving the signal:noise ratio of memory traces. Here, we reconcile these theories by highlighting the distinction between light and deep nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Specifically, we draw on recent studies to suggest a link between light NREM and active potentiation, and between deep NREM and homeostatic regulation. This framework could serve as a key for interpreting the physiology of sleep stages and reconciling inconsistencies in terminology in this field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We sought to investigate potential interactions with respect to trace dominance, strengthening, and interference associated with postencoding novelty or sleep. A learning procedure was scheduled in a watermaze that placed the impact of novelty and sleep in opposition. Distinct behavioural manipulations—context preexposure or interference during memory retrieval—differentially affected trace dominance and trace survival, respectively. Analysis of immediate early gene expression revealed parallel up-regulation in the hippocampus and cortex, sustained in the hippocampus in association with novelty but in the cortex in association with sleep. These findings shed light on dynamically interacting mechanisms mediating the stabilization of hippocampal and neocortical memory traces. Hippocampal memory traces followed by novelty were more dominant by default but liable to interference, whereas sleep engaged a lasting stabilization of cortical traces and consequent trace dominance after preexposure.},

abstract = {In rats shuttling between a variably placed landmark of origin and a fixed goal, place fields of hippocampal CA1 cells encode location in two spatial reference frames. On the initial part of the outbound journey, place fields encode location with respect to the origin while on the final segment, place fields are aligned with the goal (Gothard et al., 1996b). An abrupt switch of reference frame can be induced experimentally by shortening the distance between the origin and the goal. Two linked hypotheses concerning this effect were addressed: (1) that the persistent, landmark-referenced firing results from some internal dynamic process (e.g., path integration or "momentum") and is not a result of maintained sensory input from the landmark of origin; and (2) that this hypothetical process is generated by connections either within CA3 or between CA3 and CA1, in which case the effect might be absent from the dentate gyrus. Neuronal ensemble recordings were made simultaneously from CA1 and the dentate gyrus as rats shuttled on a linear track between a variably located box and a goal, under light or dark conditions. The box-referenced firing persisted significantly longer in the dark in both hippocampal subfields, suggesting a competitive interaction between an internal dynamic process and external sensory cues. The similarity between reference frame transitions in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region suggests that this process probably occurs before CA3, possibly in the entorhinal cortex or subiculum.},

While the rat ran toward the fixed site, the box was moved. The rat returned to the box in its new position. On the initial part of all journeys, cells fired at fixed distances from the origin, whereas on the final part, cells fired at fixed distances from the destination. Thus, on outward journeys from the box, with the box behind the rat, the position representation must have been updated by path integration. Farther along the journey, the place field map became aligned on the basis of external stimuli. The spatial representation was quantified in terms of population vectors. During shortened journeys, the vector shifted from an alignment with the origin to an alignment with the destination. The dynamics depended on the degree of mismatch with respect to the full-length journey. For small mismatches, the vector moved smoothly through intervening coordinates until the mismatch was corrected. For large mismatches, it jumped abruptly to the new coordinate. Thus, when mismatches occur, path integration and external cues interact competitively to control place-cell firing. When the same box was used in a different environment, it controlled the alignment of a different set of place cells. These data suggest that although map alignment can be controlled by landmarks, hippocampal neurons do not explicitly represent objects or events.},

The landmarks were maintained at a constant distance from each other but were moved from trial to trial within a large arena surrounded by static background cues. On each trial, the rats were released from a box to which they returned for additional food after locating the goal. The box also was located variably from trial to trial and was moved to a new location while the animals were searching for the goal site. The discharge characteristics of multiple, simultaneously recorded cells were examined with respect to the landmarks, the static background cues, and the box in which each trial started and ended. Three clear categories of cells were observed: (1) cells with location-specific firing (place cells); (2) goal/landmark-related cells that fired in the vicinity of the goal or landmarks, regardless of their location in the arena; and (3) box-related cells that fired either when the rat was in the box or as it was leaving or entering the box, regardless of its location in the arena. Disjunctive cells with separate firing fields in more than one reference frame also were observed. These results suggest that in this task a subpopulation of hippocampal cells encodes location in the fixed spatial frame, whereas other subpopulations encode location with respect to different reference frames associated with the task-relevant, mobile objects.},

Although high-resolution optical imaging of the whole brain in small animals has been achieved ex vivo, the real-time and direct monitoring of large-scale neuronal activity remains difficult, owing to the performance gap between localized, largely invasive, optical microscopy of rapid, cellular-resolved neuronal activity and whole-brain macroscopy of slow haemodynamics and metabolism. Here, we demonstrate both ex vivo and non-invasive in vivo functional optoacoustic (OA) neuroimaging of mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. The approach offers rapid, high-resolution three-dimensional snapshots of whole-brain neuronal activity maps using single OA excitations, and of stimulus-evoked slow haemodynamics and fast calcium activity in the presence of strong haemoglobin background absorption. By providing direct neuroimaging at depths and spatiotemporal resolutions superior to optical fluorescence imaging, functional OA neuroimaging bridges the gap between functional microscopy and whole-brain macroscopy.},

abstract = {Immunocytochemistry revealed in the retina of the Mongolian gerbil three immunologically distinct photoreceptor cell types. Rods comprising about 87{\%} of the total receptor population were selectively recognized by an antirhodopsin serum (AO). The most abundant cone type (11-13{\%} of photo receptors) was labeled by the monoclonal antibody COS-1, specific in mammals to the middle-to-longwave sensitive cone visual pigments. A minor cone population (2.5-5{\%} of the cones) reacted with the monoclonal antibody OS-2, shown earlier to bind to the blue cones in mammalian species. Color substitution experiments revealed on the ERG level a color discrimination capability which must be attributed to the cooperative activity of green-sensitive (COS-1 positive) and blue-sensitive (OS-2 positive) cones. We conclude that the Mongolian gerbil has a well developed cone system, and that it may possess dichromatic green-blue color vision. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Preclinical applications of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) offer the possibility to non-invasively probe whole-brain network dynamics and to investigate the determinants of altered network signatures observed in human studies. Mouse rsfMRI has been increasingly adopted by numerous laboratories worldwide. Here we describe a multi-centre comparison of 17 mouse rsfMRI datasets via a common image processing and analysis pipeline. Despite prominent cross-laboratory differences in equipment and imaging procedures, we report the reproducible identification of several large-scale resting-state networks (RSN), including a mouse default-mode network, in the majority of datasets. A combination of factors was associated with enhanced reproducibility in functional connectivity parameter estimation, including animal handling procedures and equipment performance. RSN spatial specificity was enhanced in datasets acquired at higher field strength, with cryoprobes, in ventilated animals, and under medetomidine-isoflurane combination sedation. Our work describes a set of representative RSNs in the mouse brain and highlights key experimental parameters that can critically guide the design and analysis of future rodent rsfMRI investigations.},

Here, we use a boundary vector cell (BVC) model of place cell firing to model the activity of place cells in numerous multicompartment environments. The activity of modeled place cells bears a striking resemblance to experimental data, replicating virtually every major experimental result.

abstract = {The ability to find one's way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment. Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.},

abstract = {Medial entorhinal grid cells fire in periodic, hexagonally patterned locations and are proposed to support path-integration-based navigation. The recursive nature of path integration results in accumulating error and, without a corrective mechanism, a breakdown in the calculation of location. The observed long-term stability of grid patterns necessitates that the system either performs highly precise internal path integration or implements an external landmark-based error correction mechanism. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined grid cells inbehaving rodents as they made long trajectories across an open arena. We found that error accumulates relative to time and distance traveled since the animal last encountered a boundary. This error reflects coherent drift in the grid pattern. Further, interactions with boundaries yield direction-dependent error correction, suggesting that border cells serve as a neural substrate for error correction. Theseobservations, combined with simulations of an attractor network grid cell model, demonstrate that landmarks are crucial to grid stability. Medial entorhinal grid cells exhibit spatially periodic firing patterns and are proposed to support path integration. Hardcastle etal. found that grid cells accumulate error when animals are far from environmental boundaries and provide evidence for boundary-driven error correction.},

abstract = {Surprisingly little is known of the perceptual consequences of visual or vestibular stimulation in updating our perceived position in space as we move around. We assessed the roles of visual and vestibular cues in determining the perceived distance of passive, linear self motion. Subjects were given cues to constant-acceleration motion: either optic flow presented in a virtual reality display, physical motion in the dark or combinations of visual and physical motions. Subjects indicated when they perceived they had traversed a distance that had been previously given to them either visually or physically. The perceived distance of motion evoked by optic flow was accurate relative to a previously presented visual target but was perceptually equivalent to about half the physical motion. The perceived distance of physical motion in the dark was accurate relative to a previously presented physical motion but was perceptually equivalent to a much longer visually presented distance. The perceived distance of self motion when both visual and physical cues were present was more closely perceptually equivalent to the physical motion experienced rather than the simultaneous visual motion, even when the target was presented visually. We discuss this dominance of the physical cues in determining the perceived distance of self motion in terms of capture by non-visual cues. These findings are related to emerging studies that show the importance of vestibular input to neural mechanisms that process self motion.},

abstract = {A model of place-cell firing is presented that makes quantitative predictions about specific place cells' spatial receptive fields following changes to the rat's environment. A place cell's firing rate is modeled as a function of the rat's location by the thresholded sum of the firing rates of a number of putative cortical inputs. These inputs are tuned to respond whenever an environmental boundary is at a particular distance and allocentric direction from the rat. The initial behavior of a place cell in any environment is simply determined by its set of inputs and its threshold; learning is not necessary. The model is shown to produce a good fit to the firing of individual place cells, and populations of place cells across environments of differing shape. The cells' behavior can be predicted for novel environments of arbitrary size and shape, or for manipulations such as introducing a barrier. The model can be extended to make behavioral predictions regarding spatial memory. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Behavioural flexibility is an essential survival skill, yet our understanding of its neuronal substrates is still limited. While mouse research offers unique tools to dissect the neuronal circuits involved, the measurement of flexible behaviour in mice often suffers from long training times, poor experimental control, and temporally imprecise binary (hit/miss) performance readouts. Here we present a virtual-environment task for mice that tackles these limitations. It offers fast training of vision-based rule reversals ({\~{}}100 trials per reversal) with full stimulus control and continuous behavioural readouts. By generating multiple non-binary performance metrics per trial, it provides single-trial estimates not only of response accuracy and speed, but also of underlying processes like choice certainty and alertness (discussed in detail in a companion paper). Based on these metrics, we show that mice can predict new task rules long before they are able to execute them, and that this delay varies across animals. We also provide and validate single-trial estimates of whether an error was committed with or without awareness of the task rule. By tracking in unprecedented detail the cognitive dynamics underlying flexible behaviour, this task enables new investigations into the neuronal interactions that shape behavioural flexibility moment by moment.},

abstract = {How the neocortex works is a mystery. In this paper we propose a novel framework for understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.},

Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of up to thousands of neurons and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.},

Primates have been shown to be able to navigate in virtual environments. For rodents, however, all previous attempts to develop VR systems in which rats behave in the same way as in corresponding 3-D environments have failed. The question arises as to whether, in principle, rodents can be trained to navigate in a properly designed virtual environment (VE), or whether this peculiarity is limited to primates and humans. We built a virtual reality set-up that takes the wide-angle visual system of rats into account. We show for the first time that rats learn spatial tasks in this VE quite readily. This set-up opens up new opportunities for investigations of information processing in navigation (e.g. the importance of optic flow or vestibular input).},

abstract = {The hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex are part of a brain system that maps self-location during navigation in the proximal environment1,2. In this system, correlations between neural firing and an animal's position or orientation are so evident that cell types have been given simple descriptive names, such as place cells3, grid cells4, border cells5,6 and head-direction cells7. While the number of identified functional cell types is growing at a steady rate, insights remain limited by an almost-exclusive reliance on recordings from rodents foraging in empty enclosures that are different from the richly populated, geometrically irregular environments of the natural world. In environments that contain discrete objects, animals are known to store information about distance and direction to those objects and to use this vector information to guide navigation8–10. Theoretical studies have proposed that such vector operations are supported by neurons that use distance and direction from discrete objects11,12 or boundaries13,14 to determine the animal's location, but—although some cells with vector-coding properties may be present in the hippocampus15 and subiculum16,17—it remains to be determined whether and how vectorial operations are implemented in the wider neural representation of space. Here we show that a large fraction of medial entorhinal cortex neurons fire specifically when mice are at given distances and directions from spatially confined objects. These ‘object-vector cells' are tuned equally to a spectrum of discrete objects, irrespective of their location in the test arena, as well as to a broad range of dimensions and shapes, from point-like objects to extended surfaces. Our findings point to vector coding as a predominant form of position coding in the medial entorhinal cortex.},

abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) has been suggested to support a variety of self-referential functions in humans and has been fractionated into subsystems based on distinct responses to cognitive tasks and functional connectivity architecture. Such subsystems are thought to reflect functional hierarchy and segregation within the network. Because preclinical models can inform translational studies of neuropsychiatric disorders, partitioning of the DMN in nonhuman species, which has previously not been reported, may inform both physiology and pathophysiology of the human DMN. In this study, we sought to identify constituents of the rat DMN using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging. After identifying DMN using a group-level independent-component analysis on the rs-fMRI data, modularity analyses fractionated the DMNinto an anterior and a posterior subsystem,whichwere further segregated into five modules. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrates a close relationship between fiber density and the functional connectivity between DMN regions, and provides anatomical evidence to support the detected DMN subsystems. Finally, distinct modulation was seen within and between these DMN subcomponents using a neurocognitive aging model. Taken together, these results suggest that, like the human DMN, the rat DMN can be partitioned into several subcomponents that may support distinct functions. These data encourage further investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms of DMN processing in preclinical models of both normal and disease states.},

abstract = {Temporal coding is a means of representing information by the time, as opposed to the rate, at which neurons fire. Evidence of temporal coding in the hippocampus comes from place cells, whose spike times relative to theta oscillations reflect a rat's position while running along stereotyped trajectories. This arises from the backwards shift in cell firing relative to local theta oscillations (phase precession). Here we demonstrate phase precession during place-field crossings in an open-field foraging task. This produced spike sequences in each theta cycle that disambiguate the rat's trajectory through two-dimensional space and can be used to predict movement direction. Furthermore, position and movement direction were maximally predicted from firing in the early and late portions of the theta cycle, respectively. This represents the first direct evidence of a combined representation of position, trajectory and heading in the hippocampus, organized on a fine temporal scale by theta oscillations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

However, its study has proven difficult, as timing on this scale is deeply entangled with other behaviors. Several circuit and cellular mechanisms could generate sequential or ramping activity patterns that carry timing information. Here we propose that a productive approach is to draw parallels between interval timing and spatial navigation, where direct analogies can be made between the variables of interest and the mathematical operations necessitated. Along with designing experiments that isolate or disambiguate timing behavior from other variables, new techniques will facilitate studies that directly address the neural mechanisms that are responsible for interval timing.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience, Volume 43 is July 8, 2020.

abstract = {It has been hypothesised that speed information, encoded by 'speed cells', is important for updating spatial representation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex to reflect ongoing self-movement during locomotion. However, systematic characterisation of speed representation is still lacking. In this study, we compared the speed representation of distinct cell types across sub-regions/layers in the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex of rats during exploration. Our results indicate that the preferred theta phases of individual neurons are correlated with positive/negative speed modulation and a temporal shift of speed representation in a sub-region/layer and cell type-dependent manner. Most speed cells located in entorhinal cortex layer 2 represented speed prospectively, whereas those in the CA1 and entorhinal cortex layers 3 and 5 represented speed retrospectively. In entorhinal cortex layer 2, putative CA1-projecting pyramidal cells, but not putative dentate gyrus/CA3-projecting stellate cells, represented speed prospectively. Among the hippocampal interneurons, approximately one-third of putative dendrite-targeting (somatostatin-expressing) interneurons, but only a negligible fraction of putative soma-targeting (parvalbumin-expressing) interneurons, showed negative speed modulation. Putative parvalbumin-expressing CA1 interneurons and somatostatin-expressing CA3 interneurons represented speed more retrospectively than parvalbumin-expressing CA3 interneurons. These findings indicate that speed representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is cell-type, pathway, and theta-phase dependent.},

In this study we demonstrate that in a familiar 1D circular track (i.e., a continuous space) grid cells display a novel 1D equidistant firing pattern based on integrated distance rather than travelled distance or time. In addition, field spacing is increased compared to a 2D open field, probably due to a reduced access to the visual cue in the track. This metrical modification is accompanied by a change in LFP theta oscillations, but no change in intrinsic grid cell rhythmicity, or firing activity of entorhinal speed and head-direction cells. These results suggest that in a 1D circular space grid cell spatial selectivity is shaped by path integration processes, while grid scale relies on external information.},

abstract = {The entorhinal–hippocampus network plays a central role in navigation and episodic memory formation. To investigate these interactions, we examined the effect of medial entorhinal cortex lesions on hippocampal place cell activity. Since the medial entorhinal cortex is suggested to play a role in the processing of self-motion information, we hypothesised that such processing would be necessary for maintaining stable place fields in the absence of environmental cues. Place cells were recorded as medial entorhinal cortex–lesioned rats explored a circular arena during five 16-min sessions comprising a baseline session with all sensory inputs available followed by four sessions during which environmental (i.e. visual, olfactory, tactile) cues were progressively reduced to the point that animals could rely exclusively on self-motion cues to maintain stable place fields. We found that place field stability and a number of place cell firing properties were affected by medial entorhinal cortex lesions in the baseline session. When rats were forced to rely exclusively on self-motion cues, within-session place field stability was dramatically decreased in medial entorhinal cortex rats relative to SHAM rats. These results support a major role of the medial entorhinal cortex in processing self-motion cues, with this information being conveyed to the hippocampus to help anchor and maintain a stable spatial representation during movement.},

abstract = {In earlier electrophysiological experiments on the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) evidence was obtained to suggest that the retina of this rodent contains only a single type of cone. The cones were found to have peak sensitivity of about 493 nm. Gerbil rods have peak sensitivity of about 500 nm, yielding a Purkinje shift that is small in magnitude and reversed in direction from that conventionally found among mammals. In a series of experiments we extended electrophysiological and behavioral measurements to include UV stimulation and this reveals a second photopic mechanism. Several pieces of evidence suggest this second mechanism is a cone having peak sensitivity of about 360 nm. Results from adaptation experiments show that the sensitivities of the two cone mechanisms can be independently manipulated, and thus they presumably reflect the operation of two types of cone photopigment. The results from behavioral experiments verify that the gerbil UV mechanism provides information that can be used to make visual discriminations based on intensity differences. A test of color vision additionally suggests that the two cone pigments can support some color discriminations. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Hippocampal neurons in awake animals exhibit place field activity that encodes current location, as well as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity during which representations based on past experiences are often replayed. The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making.},

abstract = {Maintaining a sense of direction requires combining information from static environmental landmarks with dynamic information about self-motion. This is accomplished by the head direction system, whose neurons – head direction cells – encode specific head directions. When the brain integrates information in sensory domains, this process is almost always ‘optimal' – that is, inputs are weighted according to their reliability. Evidence suggests cue combination by head direction cells may also be optimal. The simplicity of the head direction signal, together with the detailed knowledge we have about the anatomy and physiology of the underlying circuit, therefore makes this system a tractable model with which to discover how optimal cue combination occurs at a neural level. In the head direction system, cue interactions are thought to occur on an attractor network of interacting head direction neurons, but attractor dynamics predict a winner-take-all decision between cues, rather than optimal combination. However, optimal cue combination in an attractor could be achieved via plasticity in the feedforward connections from external sensory cues (i.e. the landmarks) onto the ring attractor. Short-term plasticity would allow rapid re-weighting that adjusts the final state of the network in accordance with cue reliability (reflected in the connection strengths), while longer term plasticity would allow long-term learning about this reliability. Although these principles were derived to model the head direction system, they could potentially serve to explain optimal cue combination in other sensory systems more generally.

abstract = {In a symmetrical environment (like a square box) hippocampal place cells use a mixture of visual and idiothetic (movement) information to tell them which way the environment is oriented. The present experiment tested the hypothesis that if the visual landmarks were mobile, place cells would learn to disregard these and rely on idiothetic cues instead. Place cells were recorded in a square box surrounded by circular black curtains. A cue card hung on the curtain behind one of the walls to break the fourfold symmetry. The relative influence of this card on the location of place fields was assessed each day by confining the rat on a rotating platter underneath an opaque cover, and then rotating the card and the platter by different amounts, to see whether subsequently recorded place fields had rotated with the card or with the rat. For some rats, these trials had been preceded by trials in which the card had been visibly moved from trial to trial, so that the rats had seen that it was mobile. Other rats received no prior visual information that the card was mobile. In the rats that had previously seen the card move, place fields initially rotated with the card but by the end of five sessions usually rotated with the rat instead. For rats that had never seen the card move, place fields always followed the card. Thus, the cells were able to 'learn' that their preferred directional input, the card, was unreliable. A third group of rats, who were covered only for 30 s while the card was moved, showed mixed behaviour, suggesting a degradation of the idiothetic trace with time.},

abstract = {The ability to recall discrete memories is thought to depend on the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks. In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3 and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},

We found that spiking patterns not only in the cortex but also in the hippocampus were organized into frames, defined as periods of stepwise increase in neuronal population activity. The multicell firing sequences evoked by awake experience were replayed during these frames in both regions. Furthermore, replay events in the sensory cortex and hippocampus were coordinated to reflect the same experience.

We tested remapping in amyloid precursor protein knockin (APP-KI) mice with impaired spatial memory. CA1 neurons, including place cells, showed disrupted remapping, although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons severely lost their spatial tuning and grid cells were almost absent. Fast gamma oscillatory coupling between the MEC and CA1 was also impaired. Mild disruption of MEC grid cells emerged in younger APP-KI mice, although the spatial memory and CA1 remapping of the animals remained intact. These results point to remapping impairment in the hippocampus, possibly linked to grid cell disruption, as circuit mechanisms underlying spatial memory impairment in AD.},

abstract = {The septal and temporal poles of the hippocampus differ markedly in their anatomical and neurochemical organization. Although it is well established that the internal representation of space is a fundamental function of hippocampal neurons, most of what is known about spatial coding in the hippocampus of freely moving animals has come from recordings from the dorsal one-third (largely for technical convenience). The present study therefore compared the spatial selectivity of CA1 neurons in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of rats during performance of a food reinforced, random search task in a square chamber containing simple visual landmarks. Neural activity was recorded in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of opposite hemispheres in the same rats, in many cases simultaneously. As in dorsal hippocampus, ventral CA1 units could be classified as 'complex spike' (pyramidal) cells or 'theta' interneurons. Both dorsal and ventral theta cells fired at relatively high rates and with low spatial selectivity in the apparatus. Of the population of complex spike cells in the ventral hippocampus, a significantly smaller number had 'place fields' than in the dorsal hippocampus, and the average spatial selectivity was of significantly lower resolution than that found among dorsal hippocampal complex spike cells. Thus, a septotemporal difference of spatial selectivity was found in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus, complementing many other anatomical and neuropharmacological studies. A number of possible functional interpretations can be suggested from these results, including a computational advantage of representing space at different scales or a preeminence of essentially nonspatial information processing in the ventral hippocampus.},

PV plasticity, which involves changes in PV and GAD67 expression and connectivity onto PV neurons, was regulated by cAMP signaling in PV neurons. Following induction, PV plasticity depended on local D1/5 dopamine receptor signaling at 0–5 h to regulate its magnitude, and at 12–14 h for its continuance, ensuring memory consolidation. D1/5 dopamine receptor activation selectively induced DARPP-32 and ERK phosphorylation in PV neurons. At 12–14 h, PV plasticity was required for enhanced sharp-wave ripple densities and c-Fos expression in pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal general network mechanisms of long-term memory consolidation that requires plasticity of PV basket cells induced after acquisition and sustained subsequently through D1/5 receptor signaling.},

abstract = {In familiar environments, the firing fields of entorhinal grid cells form regular triangular lattices. However, when the geometric shape of the environment is deformed, these time-averaged grid patterns are distorted in a grid scale-dependent and local manner. We hypothesized that this distortion in part reflects dynamic anchoring of the grid code to displaced boundaries, possibly through border cell-grid cell interactions. To test this hypothesis, we first reanalyzed two existing rodent grid rescaling datasets to identify previously unrecognized boundary-tethered shifts in grid phase that contribute to the appearance of rescaling. We then demonstrated in a computational model that boundary-tethered phase shifts, as well as scale-dependent and local distortions of the time-averaged grid pattern, could emerge from border-grid interactions without altering inherent grid scale. Together, these results demonstrate that environmental deformations induce history-dependent shifts in grid phase, and implicate border-grid interactions as a potential mechanism underlying these dynamics.},

abstract = {The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) is widely used as a model organism for the human auditory system. Its hearing range is very similar to ours and it uses the same mechanisms for sound localization. The auditory circuits underlying these functions have been characterized. However, important mechanistic details are still under debate. To elucidate these issues, precise and reversible optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in this complex circuitry is required. However, genetic and genomic resources for the Mongolian gerbil are poorly developed. Here, we demonstrate a reliable gene delivery system using an AAV8(Y337F)-pseudotyped recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) 2-based vector in which the pan-neural human synapsin (hSyn) promoter drives neuron-specific expression of CatCH (Ca2+ -permeable channelrhodopsin) or NpHR3.0 (Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin). After stereotactic injection into the gerbil's auditory brainstem (medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus) and midbrain [inferior colliculus (IC)], we characterized CatCH- and/or NpHR3.0-transduced neurons in acute brain slices by means of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. As the response properties of optogenetic tools strongly depend on neuronal biophysics, this parameterization is crucial for their in vivo application. In a proof-of-principle experiment in anesthetized gerbils, we observed strong suppression of sound-evoked neural responses in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) and IC upon light activation of NpHR3.0. The successful validation of gene delivery and optogenetic tools in the Mongolian gerbil paves the way for future studies of the auditory circuits in this model system.},

abstract = {Social interactions involve complex decision-making tasks that are shaped by dynamic, mutual feedback between participants. An open question is whether and how emergent properties may arise across brains of socially interacting individuals to influence social decisions. By simultaneously performing microendoscopic calcium imaging in pairs of socially interacting mice, we find that animals exhibit interbrain correlations of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex that are dependent on ongoing social interaction. Activity synchrony arises from two neuronal populations that separately encode one's own behaviors and those of the social partner. Strikingly, interbrain correlations predict future social interactions as well as dominance relationships in a competitive context. Together, our study provides conclusive evidence for interbrain synchrony in rodents, uncovers how synchronization arises from activity at the single-cell level, and presents a role for interbrain neural activity coupling as a property of multi-animal systems in coordinating and sustaining social interactions between individuals. When two animals interact, neural activity across their brains synchronizes in a way that predicts how they will behave and how they form social dominance relationships.},

abstract = {During spatial navigation, animals use self-motion to estimate positions through path integration. However, estimation errors accumulate over time and it is unclear how they are corrected. Here we report a new cell class (‘cue cell') encoding visual cues that could be used to correct errors in path integration in mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). During virtual navigation, individual cue cells exhibited firing fields only near visual cues and their population response formed sequences repeated at each cue. These cells consistently responded to cues across multiple environments. On a track with cues on left and right sides, most cue cells only responded to cues on one side. During navigation in a real arena, they showed spatially stable activity and accounted for 32{\%} of unidentified, spatially stable MEC cells. These cue cell properties demonstrate that the MEC contains a code representing spatial landmarks, which could be important for error correction during path integration.},

Recent advances reveal a spatiotemporal division of labor in cortical circuits, as exemplified in the CA1 hippocampal area. In particular, distinct GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing) cell types subdivide the surface of pyramidal cells and act in discrete time windows, either on the same or on different subcellular compartments. They also interact with glutamatergic pyramidal cell inputs in a domain-specific manner and support synaptic temporal dynamics, network oscillations, selection of cell assemblies, and the implementation of brain states. The spatiotemporal specializations in cortical circuits reveal that cellular diversity and temporal dynamics coemerged during evolution, providing a basis for cognitive behavior.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is critical for navigation in an open field. One component of this navigation requires the subject to recognize the target place using distal cues. The experiments presented in this report tested whether blocking hippocampal function would impair open field place recognition. Hungry rats were trained to press a lever on a feeder for food. In Experiment 1, they were passively transported with the feeder along a circular trajectory. Lever pressing was reinforced only if the feeder was passing through a 60°-wide sector. Thus, rats preferentially lever pressed in the vicinity of the reward sector indicating that they recognized its location. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) infusions aimed at the dorsal hippocampi caused rats to substantially increase lever pressing with no preference for any region. The aim of Experiment 2 was to determine whether the TTX injections caused a loss of place recognition or a general increase of lever pressing. A separate group of rats was conditioned in a stationary apparatus to press the lever in response to a light. The TTX injections did not abolish preferential lever pressing in response to light. Lever pressing increased less than half as much as the TTX-induced increase in Experiment 1. When these animals with functional hippocampi could not determine the rewarded period because the light was always off, lever pressing increased much more and was similar to the TTX-induced increase in Experiment 1. We conclude that the TTX inactivation of the hippocampi impaired the ability to recognize the reward place. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that hippocampal place fields are controlled by the salient sensory cues in the environment, in that rotation of the cues causes an equal rotation of the place fields. We trained rats to forage for food pellets in a gray cylinder with a single salient directional cue, a white card covering 90 degrees of the cylinder wall. Half of the rats were disoriented before being placed in the cylinder, in order to disrupt their internal sense of direction. The other half were not disoriented before being placed in the cylinder; for these rats, there was presumably a consistent relationship between the cue card and their internal direction sense. We subsequently recorded hippocampal place cells and thalamic head direction cells from both groups of rats as they moved in the cylinder; between some sessions the cylinder and cue card were rotated to a new direction. All rats were disoriented before recording. Under these conditions, the cue card had much weaker control over the place fields and head direction cells in the rats that had been disoriented during training than in the rats that had not been disoriented. For the former group, the place fields often rotated relative to the cue card or completely changed their firing properties between sessions. In all recording sessions, the head direction cells and place cells were strongly coupled. It appears that the strength of cue control over place cells and head direction cells depends on the rat's learned perception of the stability of the cues.},

abstract = {The most common be-havioral test of hippocampus-dependent, spatial learning and memory is the Morris water task, and the most commonly studied behavioral correlate of hippocampal neurons is the spatial specificity of place cells. Despite decades of intensive research, it is not completely understood how animals solve the water task and how place cells generate their spatially specific firing fields. Based on early work, it has become the accepted wisdom in the general neuroscience community that distal spatial cues are the primary sources of information used by animals to solve the water task (and similar spatial tasks) and by place cells to generate their spatial specificity. More recent research, along with earlier studies that were overshadowed by the emphasis on distal cues, put this common view into question by demonstrating primary influences of local cues and local boundaries on spatial behavior and place-cell firing. This paper first reviews the historical underpinnings of the "standard" view from a behavioral perspective, and then reviews newer results demonstrating that an animal's behavior in such spatial tasks is more strongly controlled by a local-apparatus frame of reference than by distal landmarks. The paper then reviews similar findings from the literature on the neurophysiological correlates of place cells and other spatially correlated cells from related brain areas. A model is proposed by which distal cues primarily set the orientation of the animal's internal spatial coordinate system, via the head direction cell system, whereas local cues and apparatus boundaries primarily set the translation and scale of that coordinate system.},

We review new data which suggest that this simple dichotomy between 'where' versus 'what' needs revision. We propose a refinement of this model, which is more complex than the simple spatial- non-spatial dichotomy. MEC is proposed to be involved in path integration computations based on a global frame of reference, primarily using internally generated, self-motion cues and external input about environmental boundaries and scenes; it provides the hippocampus with a coordinate system that underlies the spatial context of an experience. LEC is proposed to process information about individual items and locations based on a local frame of reference, primarily using external sensory input; it provides the hippocampus with information about the content of an experience. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor.

abstract = {How the brain combines information from different sensory modalities and of differing reliability is an important and still-unanswered question. Using the head direction (HD) system as a model, we explored the resolution of conflicts between landmarks and background cues. Sensory cue integration models predict averaging of the two cues, whereas attractor models predict capture of the signal by the dominant cue. We found that a visual landmark mostly captured the HD signal at low conflicts: however, therewas an increasing propensity for the cells to integrate the cues thereafter. A large conflict presented to naive rats resulted in greater visual cue capture (less integration) than in experienced rats, revealing an effect of experience. We propose that weighted cue integration in HD cells arises from dynamic plasticity of the feed-forward inputs to the network, causing within-trial spatial redistribution of the visual inputs onto the ring. This suggests that an attractor network can implement decision processes about cue reliability using simple architecture and learning rules, thus providing a potential neural substrate forweighted cue integration. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent.

abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are known to disinhibit cortical neurons. However, it is unclear how disinhibition, occurring at the single-cell level, interacts with network-level patterns of activity to shape complex behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of prefrontal VIP interneurons in a widely studied mouse behavior: deciding whether to explore or avoid the open arms of an elevated plus maze. VIP interneuron activity increases in the open arms and disinhibits prefrontal responses to hippocampal inputs, which are known to transmit signals related to open arm avoidance. Indeed, inhibiting VIP interneurons disrupts network-level representations of the open arms and decreases open arm avoidance specifically when hippocampal-prefrontal theta synchrony is strong. Thus, VIP interneurons effectively gate the ability of hippocampal input to generate prefrontal representations, which drive avoidance behavior. This shows how VIP interneurons enable cortical circuits to integrate specific inputs into network-level representations that guide complex behaviors. Video Abstract: [Figure presented] How VIP interneurons modulate network-level activity to regulate behavior is not understood. Lee et al. show that in the elevated plus maze, prefrontal VIP neurons promote open arm avoidance by disinhibiting theta-frequency communication that transmits anxiety-related information across hippocampal-prefrontal networks.},

Computational models suggest that the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus plays an essential role in encoding and retrieval of spatial memory.

A possible functional dissociation between these afferent inputs was attempted using a simple navigation test (i.e., the modified Hebb-Williams maze). Behavioral testing was combined with electrolytic lesions of PPCA3 or neurotoxic lesions of the DG, to eliminate each afferent input into CA3. Lesions in either afferent input into CA3 affected learning of an effective navigational path on the maze. The contributions of the two CA3 afferent inputs, however, were different regarding encoding and retrieval of memory measured based on indices operationally defined for the behavioral paradigm (i.e., encoding, the number of errors reduced within a day; retrieval, the number of errors reduced between days). The DG-lesioned animals exhibited deficits regarding the encoding index, but not the retrieval index, whereas the PPCA3-lesioned rats displayed deficits regarding the retrieval index, but not the encoding index.

To better understand cue and place memory representation in CA1, and how these interact during goal-directed navigation, we investigated population activity in CA1 during memory encoding and retrieval in a novel water task with two visibly distinct platforms, using mRNA for immediate early genes Arc and Homer1a as markers of neural activity. After training, relocating cues to new places induces an extensive, perhaps global, remapping of the memory code that is accompanied by altered navigation and rapid learning of new cue-place information. In addition, we have found a significant relationship between the extent of reactivation and overall cue choice accuracy.

abstract = {Theoretical models have long pointed to the dentate gyrus as a possible source of neuronal pattern seperation. In agreement with predictions from these models, we show that minimal changes in the shape of the environment in which rats are exploring can substantially alter correlated activity patterns among place-modulated granule cells in the dentate gyrus. When the environments are made more different, new cell populations are recruited in CA3 but not in the dentate gyrus. These results imply a dual mechanism for pattern separation in which signals from the entorhinal cortex can be decorrelated both by coincidence patterns in the dendate gyrus and by recruitment of nonoverlapping cell assemblies in CA3.},

abstract = {Hippocampal neurons were recorded under conditions in which the recording chamber was varied but its location remained unchanged versus conditions in which an identical chamber was encountered in different places. Two forms of neuronal pattern separation occurred. In the variable cue-constant place condition, the firing rates of active cells varied, often over more than an order of magnitude, whereas the location of firing remained constant. In the variable place-constant cue condition, both location and rates changed, so that population vectors for a given location in the chamber were statistically independent. These independent encoding schemes may enable simultaneous representation of spatial and episodic memory information.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells are thought to form a representation of space by integrating internal and external sensory cues. Experimental data show that different subsets of place cells are controlled by vision, self-motion or a combination of both. Moreover, recent studies in environments with a high degree of visual aliasing suggest that a continuous interaction between place cells and grid cells can result in a deformation of hexagonal grids or in a progressive loss of visual cue control over grid fields. The computational nature of such a bidirectional interaction remains unclear. In this work we present a neural network model of the dynamic interaction between place cells and grid cells within the entorhinal–hippocampal processing loop. The model was tested in two recent experimental paradigms involving environments with visually similar compartments that provided conflicting evidence about visual cue control over self-motion-based spatial codes. Analysis of the model behavior suggests that the strength of entorhinal–hippocampal dynamical loop is the key parameter governing differential cue control in multi-compartment environments. Moreover, construction of separate spatial representations of visually identical compartments required a progressive weakening of visual cue control over place fields in favor of self-motion based mechanisms. More generally our results suggest a functional segregation between plastic and dynamic processes in hippocampal processing.},

abstract = {Studies on foraging rats suggest that they can use visual, olfactory, and self-movement cues for spatial guidance, but their relative reliance on these different cues is not well understood. In the present study, rats left a hidden refuge to search for a large food pellet located somewhere on a circular table, and the accuracy with which they returned to the refuge with the food pellet was measured. Cue use was manipulated by administering probe trials from novel locations, blindfolding, moving the home cage relative to the table, rotating the table and using combinations of these manipulations. When visual cues were available and a consistent starting location used, a visual strategy dominated performance. When blindfolded, the rats used olfactory cues from the surface of the table and from the starting hole. When olfactory stimuli were made uninformative, by changing the starting hole and rotating the table, the rats still homed accurately, suggesting they used self-movement cues. In a number of cue combinations, in which cues gave conflicting information, performance degraded. The results suggest that rats display a hierarchical preference in using visual, olfactory and self- movement cues while at the same time being able to reaffirm or switch between various cue combinations. The results are discussed in relation to ideas concerning the neural basis of spatial navigation.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is critical to remembering the flow of events in distinct experiences and, in doing so, bridges temporal gaps between discontiguous events. Here, we report a robust hippocampal representation of sequence memories, highlighted by "time cells" that encode successive moments during an empty temporal gap between the key events, while also encoding location and ongoing behavior. Furthermore, just as most place cells "remap" when a salient spatial cue is altered, most time cells form qualitatively different representations (" retime") when the main temporal parameter is altered. Hippocampal neurons also differentially encode the key events and disambiguate different event sequences to compose unique, temporally organized representations of specific experiences. These findings suggest that hippocampal neural ensembles segment temporally organized memories much the same as they represent locations of important events in spatially defined environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Large parts of our knowledge about the physiology of the hippocampus in the intact brain are derived from studies in rats and mice. While many of those findings fit well to the limited data available from humans and primates, there are also marked differences, for example in hippocampal oscillation frequencies and in the persistence of theta oscillations. To test whether the distinct sensory specializations of the visual and auditory system of primates play a key role in explaining these differences, we recorded basic hippocampal physiological properties in Mongolian gerbils, a rodent species with high visual acuity and good low-frequency hearing, similar to humans. We found that gerbils show only minor differences to rats regarding hippocampal place field activity, theta properties (frequency, persistence, phase precession, theta compression), and sharp wave ripple events. The only major difference between rats and gerbils was a considerably higher degree of head direction selectivity in gerbil CA3 place fields, which may be explained by their visual system being able to better resolve distant cues. Thus, differences in sensory specializations between rodent species only affect hippocampal circuit dynamics to a minor extent, which implies that differences to other mammalian lineages, such as bats and primates, cannot be solely explained by specialization in the auditory or visual system.},

abstract = {A biologically inspired two level method is proposed for real-time path planning in a complex and dynamic environment, employable in ground vehicles. This method takes the advantage of both global and local path finding procedures. In the first level, i.e., global level, the planner utilizes a neural network architecture as a sensory-motor map, similar to the cognitive map used by humans, and an optimization algorithm to produce a coarse path. In the second level, i.e., local level, the global path is improved by employing a model-based prediction method with a finite prediction horizon in a way that future information about the environment is involved in the planner's decision making. In the suggested method, the prediction horizon is variable and is adjusted in each step of the planning in agreement with the kinematic features of the closest obstacle in the visual field of the planner. We considered four different path planning tasks in a virtual dynamic environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against the human path planning strategy. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to plan a strategy comparable to the driving scenarios chosen by most subjects and to generate a real-time collision-free path in a dynamic environment with obstacles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The more specific the model, the less it will be possible to apply it to different situations; the more general its nature, the less adequately it will represent the details of the behaviour to be modelled.

The usefulness and limits of the different perspectives is discussed, in particular how well the models fit with observations.

One hypothesis holds that optimal states exhibit tonically depolarized cortical neurons with enhanced spiking activity, such as occur during movement. We recorded membrane potentials of auditory cortical neurons in mice trained on a challenging tone-in-noise detection task while assessing arousal with simultaneous pupillometry and hippocampal recordings. Arousal measures accurately predicted multiple modes of membrane potential activity, including rhythmic slow oscillations at low arousal, stable hyperpolarization at intermediate arousal, and depolarization during phasic or tonic periods of hyper-arousal. Walking always occurred during hyper-arousal. Optimal signal detection behavior and sound-evoked responses, at both sub-threshold and spiking levels, occurred at intermediate arousal when pre-decision membrane potentials were stably hyperpolarized. These results reveal a cortical physiological signature of the classically observed inverted-U relationship between task performance and arousal and that optimal detection exhibits enhanced sensory-evoked responses and reduced background synaptic activity.},

Its location between the key players of the circuit, CA3 and CA1, which along with the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus compose the classic trisynaptic circuit, further distracted research interest. However, the connectivity of CA2 pyramidal cells, together with unique patterns of gene expression, hints at a much larger contribution to hippocampal information processing than has been ascribed. Here we review recent advances that have identified new roles for CA2 in hippocampal centric processing, together with specialized functions in social memory and, potentially, as a broadcaster of novelty. These new data, together with CA2's role in disease, justify a closer look at how this small region exerts its influence and how it might best be exploited to understand and treat disease-related circuit dysfunctions.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience, Volume 43 is July 8, 2020.

abstract = {Hebbian learning, the development of neural circuits based on correlated activity, relies on two critical mechanisms. The best known of these is activity-dependent synaptic modification along the lines proposed by Hebb 1. Equally important is a mechanism that forces different synapses to compete with one another so that when some synapses to a given postsynaptic neuron are strengthened, others are weakened 2,3. For example, correlation-based rules of synaptic modification can provide a reasonable account of many aspects of development in visual cortex, but only when they are combined with constraints introduced to ensure competition 4. Although Hebbian synaptic modification has received support from experiments on long-term potentia-tion and depression 5 , much less is known about the mechanisms that generate competition between synapses. At first, it might seem that any mechanism that imposes competition among synapses must involve a global intracellular signal that reflects the state of many synapses. The constraints used in many models of Hebbian learning 6 , although not biophysi-cally realistic, are based on this idea. Typically these constraints limit the sum of synaptic strengths received by a cell, or the mean activity of the cell. Competition can also arise locally if the processes that modify synaptic strengths equilibrate at a preset level of total synaptic innervation or postsynaptic activity. This can be achieved through static mechanisms such as thresholds and negative input correlations 6 , dynamic mechanisms involving non-Hebbian synaptic growth or decay terms such as synap-tic scaling 7-9 , or shifts in the synaptic modification rule itself as in the sliding threshold of the BCM model 10. Here we explore an entirely different mechanism suggested by experimental results on the effect of spike timing on long-term synaptic modification 11-20 , in which different synapses compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. We show that the dependence of synaptic modification on spike timing provides a mechanism that can lead to competitive Hebbian learning without requiring global intracellular signaling, or preset activity or synaptic efficacy levels. Experimental evidence from several different preparations 11-20 suggests that both the sign and degree of synaptic modification arising from repeated pairing of pre-and postsynaptic action potentials depend on their relative timing. In neocortical slices 14 , hippocampal slice 17 and cell 18 cultures, and tadpole tectum in vivo 19 , long-term strengthening of synapses occurs if presynaptic action potentials precede postsynaptic firing by no more than about 50 ms. Presynaptic action potentials that follow postsy-naptic spikes produce long-term weakening of synapses. The largest changes in synaptic efficacy occur when the time difference between pre-and postsynaptic action potentials is small, and there is a sharp transition from strengthening to weakening as this time difference passes through zero. We call this form of synaptic modification spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Synaptic modification by STDP-like rules has been studied in models of temporal pattern recognition 21 , temporal sequence learning 22-24 , coincidence detection 25,26 , navigation 27-29 and direction selectivity 30,31 (N.J. Buchs, J. Reutimann {\&} W. Senn, Soc. Neu-rosci. Abstr. 25, 2259, 1999). We focus instead on the competitive and stabilizing properties of STDP. The competitive nature of STDP has been noted 19,25 , but not studied in detail. Stability of an STDP-like rule in combination with non-Hebbian plasticity has been studied in a linear, stochastically spiking neuron model 32 , but we find qualitatively new behavior when the intrinsic non-linearity of the spike-generation mechanism is taken into account. We find that STDP alone can lead to stable distributions of synap-tic conductances, subject only to a limit on the strengths of individual synapses. The synaptic conductance distributions produced articles Hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between different synapses. One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre-and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

abstract = {In order to meet physical and behavioural demands of their environments animals constantly update their body posture, but little is known about the neural signals on which this ability depends. To better understand the role of cortex in coordinating natural pose and movement, we tracked the heads and backs of freely foraging rats in 3D while recording simultaneously from posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and frontal motor cortex (M2), areas critical for spatial movement planning and navigation. Single units in both regions were tuned mainly to postural features of the head, back and neck, and much less so to their movement. Representations of the head and back were organized topographically across PPC and M2, and the tuning peaks of the cells were distributed in an efficient manner, where substantially fewer cells encoded postures that occurred more often. Postural signals in both areas were sufficiently robust to allow reconstruction of ongoing behavior with 90{\%} accuracy. Together, these findings demonstrate that both parietal and frontal motor cortices maintain an efficient, organized representation of 3D posture during unrestrained behavior.},

abstract = {Arthropods as well as mammals are able to return straight home after a random search excursion under conditions that are designed to exclude all external cues. After a brief clarification of the terminology, two principal systems of information processing that can achieve this performance are introduced and analysed: Polar versus Cartesian path integration. The different demands and achievements of the two systems are confronted with neurophysiological findings on the functioning of the hippocampus, and with a recent comprehensive model of how the hippocampal place cells perform path integration. To connect the neurophysiological findings with the behavior of the animal, a new model is developed. It achieves three functionally diverse performances: maintenance and control of a compass direction, navigation by path integration, and formation of goals by connecting non-spatial features with their location. This is done by three interconnected feedback loops, set by a common reference variable. Their information-processing structure enables the animal not only to home but also to go straight from any stored goal to any other, without explicit representation of the distance between them, and without a topological arrangement of the store. The model explains behaviors not yet understood and predicts still undiscovered performances. Because it allows the isolation of orienting from storing functions yet also shows how they can be connected, the model may help to reconcile conflicting views on the function of the hippocampus.},

abstract = {The spiking activity of cortical neurons is highly variable. This variability is generally correlated among nearby neurons, an effect commonly interpreted to reflect the coactivation of neurons due to anatomically shared inputs. Recent findings, however, indicate that correlations can be dynamically modulated, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investi-gate the hypothesis that correlations are dominated by neuronal coinactivation: the occurrence of brief silent periods during which all neurons in the local network stop firing. We recorded spiking activity from large populations of neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats across different brain states. During spontaneous activity, the reduction of correlation accompanying brain state de-synchronization was largely explained by a decrease in the density of the silent periods. The presentation of a stimulus caused an initial drop of correlations followed by a rebound, a time course that was mimicked by the instantaneous silence density. We built a rate network model with fluctuation-driven transitions between a silent and an active attractor and assumed that neurons fired Poisson spike trains with a rate following the model dynamics. Variations of the network external input altered the transition rate into the silent attractor and reproduced the relation between correlation and silence density found in the data, both in spontaneous and evoked conditions. This suggests that the observed changes in correlation, occurring gradually with brain state variations or abruptly with sensory stimulation, are due to changes in the likeliness of the microcircuit to transiently cease firing. neuronal variability | noise correlations | brain state | auditory cortex | stochastic network dynamics N euronal noise correlations are defined as common fluctua-tions in the spiking activity of neurons under conditions of constant sensory input or motor output. Traditionally, they have been thought to arise from the dense connectivity of the cortex, such that neighboring neurons sharing a fraction of their inputs should also share a fraction of their output variability (1). Several observations are consistent with this hypothesis: pairwise corre-lations in the cortex decrease with cell pair distance (2) or with the difference in stimulus selectivity (3), dependencies that could follow from a variation in shared input given the anatomy of cortical circuits. Recent findings, however, challenge this simple interpretation. Recordings in the primate visual cortex have shown that attention or task context can change correlation structure (4–6) and that the magnitude of averaged correlation can be very low (7). In anesthetized rodents correlations decrease with brain state desynchronization (8, 9) or when animals switch from quiet wakefulness to active whisking during waking (10). Moreover, the commonly observed drop of spiking variability following stimulus onset (11–13) seems to occur jointly with a transient decrease in correlation (2, 14, 15). These observations suggest that correlations reflect the dynamical state of the circuit more than its hardwired connectivity. Despite substantial progress in understanding the mechanisms giving rise to large individual variability in recurrent networks (9, 16–18), we still lack a canonical model that can generate cor-relations with the same magnitude and spatiotemporal structure as those observed in cortical circuits. Balanced networks, for instance, a common model that reproduces the large variability of cortical neurons (9, 18, 19), show near-zero averaged correlations (9). Nu-merous studies have investigated the generation of synchronous firing (20), but whether short bursts of population activity can quantitatively account for the spike count correlations found in the data is unclear. Recurrent networks can also generate fast oscil-lations in the population activity, but, in a regime of low rates, typical of cortical circuits, average spike count correlations are negligible (21). Network models producing nonzero average corre-lations are those exhibiting up and down dynamics (22–29). Most of these studies have focused on investigating the mechanisms un-derlying the slow oscillatory activity observed in cortical slices (30), under anesthesia (31, 32), or during slow-wave sleep (33). Only recently the impact of up and down switching on trial-to-trial re-sponse variability (25) and on the probability distribution of multi-unit activity (29) across brain states has been investigated. Whether the alternation between up and down phases could quantitatively account for the pairwise correlations observed in different brain states and describe their stimulus-evoked dynamics remains an open question. To investigate the mechanisms producing correlated firing, we recorded the spiking activity of large populations of neurons from the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. During spontaneous activity, changes in correlation were largely explained by variation of the occurrence rate of periods during which neurons in the circuit stopped firing. Furthermore, the time course of correla-tion in response to an acoustic stimulus reflected the transient variation of this silence density. A computational rate model},

We show that the observed responses to environmental manipulations arise as a natural result under the general framework of feedforward models with spatially unstructured feedback inhibition, which puts the development of triangular patterns in the context of a Turing pattern formation process over physical space.

abstract = {Spatial navigation is the most frequently used behavioral paradigm to study hippocampal dependent memory formation in rodents. However, commonly used tasks can present some limitations: i) they are labor intensive, preventing the implementation of parallel testing for high-throughput experimentation; ii) yield a low number of repeated trials, curtailing the statistical power; iii) are hard to combine with neural recordings, because tethering sometimes interferes with behavior; iv) are not based on overt behavioral responses that can be precisely timed, making difficult the identification of the underlying neural events; v) produce a low spatial coverage, limiting the characterization of neuronal patterns related to spatial information. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a spatial memory task that required minimal human intervention, allowed simultaneous and unsupervised testing of several mice, and yielded a high number of recall trials per session (up to {\~{}}20). Moreover, because recall sessions could be repeated over many days, the task provided enough statistical power to characterize in detail the animal behavior during memory recall, even to quantify the decay in spatial accuracy of memories as they are stacked across days. In addition, the task is compatible with neural activity recordings. Together, these features make our task a valuable tool to start dissecting the neural circuit dynamics underlying spatial memory recall.},

abstract = {Using the techniques set out in the preceding paper (Muller et al., 1987), we investigated the response of place cells to changes in the animal's environment. The standard apparatus used was a cylinder, 76 cm in diameter, with walls 51 cm high. The interior was uniformly gray except for a white cue card that ran the full height of the wall and occupied 100 degrees of arc. The floor of the apparatus presented no obstacles to the animal's motions. Each of these major features of the apparatus was varied while the others were held constant. One set of manipulations involved the cue card. Rotating the cue card produced equal rotations of the firing fields of single cells. Changing the width of the card did not affect the size, shape, or radial position of firing fields, although sometimes the field rotated to a modest extent. Removing the cue card altogether also left the size, shape, and radial positions of firing fields unchanged, but caused fields to rotate to unpredictable angular positions. The second set of manipulations dealt with the size and shape of the apparatus wall. When the standard (small) cylinder was scaled up in diameter and height by a factor of 2, the firing fields of 36{\%} of the cells observed in both cylinders also scaled, in the sense that the field stayed at the same angular position and at the same relative radial position. Of the cells recorded in both cylinders, 52{\%} showed very different firing patterns in one cylinder than in the other. The remaining 12{\%} of the cells were virtually silent in both cylinders. Similar results were obtained when individual cells were recorded in both a small and a large rectangular enclosure. By contrast, when the apparatus floor plan was changed from circular to rectangular, the firing pattern of a cell in an apparatus of one shape could not be predicted from a knowledge of the firing pattern in the other shape. The final manipulations involved placing vertical barriers into the otherwise unobstructed floor of the small cylinder. When an opaque barrier was set up to bisect a previously recorded firing field, in almost all cases the firing field was nearly abolished. This was true even though the barrier occupied only a small fraction of the firing field area. A transparent barrier was effective as the opaque barrier in attenuating firing fields. The lead base used to anchor the vertical barriers did not affect place cell firing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {A key feature of perception is that the interpretation of a single, continuously available stimulus can change from time to time. This aspect of perception is well illustrated by the use of ambiguous figures that can be seen in two different ways. When people view such a stimulus they almost universally describe what they are seeing as jumping between two states. If it is agreed that this perceptual phenomenon is causally linked to the activity of nerve cells, the state jumps would have to occur in conjunction with changes in neural activity somewhere in the nervous system. Our experiments suggest that hippocampal place cells are part of a perceptual system. We conducted variations of a 'cue-card rotation' experiment on rats in which the angular position of a prominent visual stimulus on the wall of cylinder is changed in the rat's presence. The three main results are that (i) place-cell firing fields remain stationary if the cue is rotated by 180 degrees, so the relation between the cue and the field is altered; (ii) firing fields rotate by 45 degrees when the cue is rotated by 45 degrees, so the relation between the field and the card is maintained; and (iii) if the cue is first rotated by 180 degrees and then rotated in a series of 45 degrees steps, the field winds up at a different angular position relative to the card when the card is back in its original position. Thus, place cells can fire in two different ways in response to a continuously viewed stimulus. We conclude that place cells reveal that the hippocampal mapping system also has properties expected of a perceptual system.},

abstract = {A key question in the analysis of hippocampal memory relates to how attention modulates the encoding and long-term retrieval of spatial and nonspatial representations in this region. To address this question, we recorded from single cells over a period of 5 days in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus while mice acquired one of two goal-oriented tasks. These tasks required the animals to find a hidden food reward by attending to either the visuospatial environment or a particular odor presented in shifting spatial locations. Attention to the visuospatial environment increased the stability of visuospatial representations and phase locking to gamma oscillations - a form of neuronal synchronization thought to underlie the attentional mechanism necessary for processing task-relevant information. Attention to a spatially shifting olfactory cue compromised the stability of place fields and increased the stability of reward-associated odor representations, which were most consistently retrieved during periods of sniffing and digging when animals were restricted to the cup locations. Together, these results suggest that attention selectively modulates the encoding and retrieval of hippocampal representations by enhancing physiological responses to task-relevant information. {\textcopyright} 2009 Muzzio et al.},

abstract = {The brain performs many nonlinear computations through intricate spiking neural networks (SNNs). How neural network dynamics relate to arbitrary computations under these constraints is still an open question. As a strong constraint, these networks are hypothesized to be robust to perturbations and use minimal energy. The theory of Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) derives the required connectivity and dynamics for both information representation and linear dynamical systems from first principles, and achieves robustness and efficiency. Nonlinear dynamical systems have thus far only been implemented in SCNs by filtering neural inputs through sets of nonlinear dendritic basis functions. While this approach works well, it relies on providing a rich enough basis set as well as supervised training of the connectivity weights. Another way to implement nonlinear computations is through multiplicatively interacting synapses. However, there is currently no principled way to implement such synapses in SCNs. Here, we extend the core SCN derivations to implement polynomial dynamical systems, from which also the need for such multiplicatively interacting synapses arises. We demonstrate our approach with a highly accurate Lorenz attractor implementation, as well as a second-order approximation of a double pendulum. We additionally demonstrate how to implement higher-order polynomials using sequential networks with only pair-wise synapses. Finally, we derive upper bounds and expected numbers of connections based on the sparsity of the underlying representation. Overall, our work provides an alternative way to directly implement nonlinear computations in spike coding networks, and expands our understanding about the potential functions of multiplicative synapses. Furthermore, due to the high accuracy and low energy usage of our approach, this work may be of interest for neuromorphic computing.},

abstract = {Keeping track of unseen objects is an important spatial skill. In order to do this, people must situate the object in terms of different frames of reference, including body position (egocentric frame of reference), landmarks in the surrounding environment (extrinsic frame reference), or other attached features (intrinsic frame of reference). Nardini et al. hid a toy in one of 12 cups in front of children, turned the array when they were not looking, and then asked them to point to the cup with the toy. This forced children to use the intrinsic frame (information about the array of cups) to locate the hidden toy. Three-year-olds made systematic errors by using the wrong frame of reference, 4-year-olds were at chance, and only 5-and 6-year-olds were successful. Can we better understand the developmental change that takes place at four years? This paper uses a modelling approach to re-examine the data and distinguish three possible strategies that could lead to the previous results at four years: (1) Children were choosing cups randomly, (2) Children were pointing between the egocentric/extrinsic-cued location and the correct target, and (3) Children were pointing near the egocentric/extrinsic-cued location on some trials and near the target on the rest. Results heavily favor the last possibility: 4-year-olds were not just guessing or trying to combine the available frames of reference. They were using the intrinsic frame on some trials, but not doing so consistently. These insights suggest that accounts of improving spatial performance at 4 years need to explain why there is a mixture of responses. Further application of the selected model also suggests that children become both more reliant on the correct frame and more accurate with any chosen frame as they mature.},

abstract = {Extracellular microelectrodes have been widely used to measure brain activity, yet there are still basic questions about the requirements for a good extracellular microelectrode. One common source of confusion is how an electrode's impedance affects the amplitude of extracellular spikes and background noise. Here we discuss how an electrode's impedance affects data quality in extracellular recordings, which is crucial for both the detection of spikes and their assignment to the correct neurons. This study employs commercial polytrodes containing 32 electrodes (177 $\mu$m2) arranged in a dense array. This allowed us to directly compare, side-by-side, the same extracellular signals measured by modified low impedance ({\~{}}100 kOhm) microelectrodes with unmodified high impedance ({\~{}}1 MOhm) microelectrodes. We begin with an evaluation of existing protocols to lower the impedance of the electrodes. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) electrodeposition protocol is a simple, stable, and reliable method for decreasing the impedance of a microelectrode up to tenfold. We next record in vivo using polytrodes that are modified in a 'chess board' pattern, such that the signal of one neuron is detected by multiple coated and non-coated electrodes. The performance of the coated and non-coated electrodes is then compared on measures of background noise and amplitude of the detected action potentials. If the proper recording system is used, then the impedance of a microelectrode within the range of standard polytrodes ({\~{}} 0.1 to 2 MOhm) does not significantly affect data quality and spike sorting. This study should encourage neuroscientists to stop worrying about one more unknown.},

Combining real-time optical tracking and behavioral analysis with remote-controlled stimulus-reward boxes, this system allows direct interactions with animals in their habitat. EthoLoop continuously provides close-up views of the tracked individuals and thus allows high-resolution behavioral analysis using deep-learning methods. The behaviors detected on the fly can be automatically reinforced either by classical conditioning or by optogenetic stimulation via wirelessly controlled portable devices. Finally, by combining 3D tracking with wireless neurophysiology we demonstrate the existence of place-cell-like activity in the hippocampus of freely moving primates. Taken together, we show that the EthoLoop framework enables interactive, well-controlled and reproducible neuroethological studies in large-field naturalistic settings.},

abstract = {Episodic and spatial memories each involve the encoding of complex associations in hippocampal neuronal circuits. Such memory traces could be stabilised from short- to long-term forms by consolidation processes involving the 'reactivation' of the original network firing patterns during sleep and rest. Waking experience can be replayed in many different brain areas, but an important role for the hippocampus lies in the organisation of the 'reactivation' process. Emerging evidence suggests that sharp wave/ripple (SWR) events in the hippocampus could coordinate the reactivation of memory traces and direct their reinstatement in cortical circuits. Although the mechanisms remain uncertain, there is a growing consensus that such SWR-directed reactivation of brain-wide memory traces could underlie memory consolidation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The consolidation of spatial memory depends on the reactivation ('replay') of hippocampal place cells that were active during recent behaviour. Such reactivation is observed during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)-synchronous oscillatory electrical events that occur during non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep 1-8 and whose disruption impairs spatial memory 3,5,6,8. Although the hippocampus also encodes a wide range of non-spatial forms of declarative memory, it is not yet known whether SWRs are necessary for such memories. Moreover, although SWRs can arise from either the CA3 or the CA2 region of the hippocampus 7,9 , the relative importance of SWRs from these regions for memory consolidation is unknown. Here we examine the role of SWRs during the consolidation of social memory-the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a member of the same species-focusing on CA2 because of its essential role in social memory 10-12. We find that ensembles of CA2 pyramidal neurons that are active during social exploration of previously unknown conspecifics are reactivated during SWRs. Notably, disruption or enhancement of CA2 SWRs suppresses or prolongs social memory, respectively. Thus, SWR-mediated reactivation of hippocampal firing related to recent experience appears to be a general mechanism for binding spatial, temporal and sensory information into high-order memory representations, including social memory. To study the role of SWRs in social memory, we used a social-recognition task that assesses social-memory formation in mice without interference from other social behaviours. In this task, a subject mouse is habituated to a square arena with two empty wire cups in opposite corners. After habituation, a previously unknown 'stimulus' mouse is placed in each of the cups (mice S 1 and S 2). In trial 1, the subject mouse is allowed to explore the arena and stimulus animals for five minutes; this phase is followed by a second five-minute trial with the positions of the same stimulus mice rotated 180° relative to trial 1 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). A one-hour sleep session precedes (pre-sleep) and follows (post-sleep) the two learning trials. After the post-sleep period, one of the stimulus mice (chosen at random) is exchanged for a third novel mouse (N) and a memory-recall trial is performed. We found that animals interacted for equal times with mice S 1 and S 2 in the two learning trials, but showed a significant preference, in terms of increased interaction time, for the novel versus the now-familiar stimulus mouse in the recall trial; this preference was quantified using a discrimination index (Fig. 1b and Methods). No other behavioural differences were noted between learning and recall trials (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d). The preference for the novel mouse demonstrated the successful encoding and consolidation of social memory of the stimulus mice.},

abstract = {Advances in silicon probe technology mean that in vivo electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of channels will soon become commonplace. To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort.},

This review presents common elements found in mammalian spatial mapping systems, focusing on the cells in the hippocampal formation representing orientational and locational spatial information, and ‘core' mammalian hippocampal circuitry. Mammalian spatial mapping systems make use of both allothetic cues (space-defining cues in the external environment) and idiothetic cues (cues derived from self-motion). As examples of each cue type, we discuss: environmental boundaries, which control both orientational and locational neuronal activity and behaviour; and ‘path integration' a process that allows the estimation of linear translation from velocity signals, thought to depend upon grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. Building cognitive maps entails sampling environments: we consider how the mapping system controls exploration to acquire spatial information, and how exploratory strategies may integrate idiothetic with allothetic information. We discuss how ‘replay' may act to consolidate spatial maps, and simulate trajectories to aid navigational planning. Finally, we discuss grid cell models of vector navigation. Poulter et al. review the specialised brain systems that underpin navigation in mammals, highlighting mechanisms that integrate external-cue and self-motion information to locate an animal with respect to its environment - assisted by the building and consolidation of “cognitive maps” - and drive exploration and spatial planning.},

Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recurrent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory-guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures.},

abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal's position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations.},

abstract = {The hippocampal cognitive map is thought to be driven by distal visual cues and self-motion cues. However, other sensory cues also influence place cells. Hence, we measured rat hippocampal activity in virtual reality (VR), where only distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues provided spatial information, and in the real world (RW). In VR, place cells showed robust spatial selectivity; however, only 20{\%} were track active, compared with 45{\%} in the RW. This indicates that distal visual and nonvestibular self-motion cues are sufficient to provide selectivity, but vestibular and other sensory cues present in RW are necessary to fully activate the place-cell population. In addition, bidirectional cells preferentially encoded distance along the track in VR, while encoding absolute position in RW. Taken together, these results suggest the differential contributions of these sensory cues in shaping the hippocampal population code. Theta frequency was reduced, and its speed dependence was abolished in VR, but phase precession was unaffected, constraining mechanisms governing both hippocampal theta oscillations and temporal coding. These results reveal cooperative and competitive interactions between sensory cues for control over hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity and theta rhythm.},

abstract = {In this report we describe a model that applies Marr's theory of hippocampal function to the problem of map-based navigation. Like many others we attribute a spatial memory function to the hippocampus, but we suggest that the additional functional components required for map-based navigation are located elsewhere in the brain. One of the key functional components in this model is an egocentric map of space, located in the neocortex, that is continuously updated using ideo? (self-motion) information. The hippocampus stores snapshots of this egocentric map. The modeled activity pattern of head direction cells is used to set the best egocentric map rotation to match the snapshots stored in the hippocampus, resulting in place cells with a nondirectional firing pattern. We describe an evaluation of this model using a mobile robot and demonstrate that with this model the robot can recognize an environment and find a hidden goal. This model is discussed in the context of prior experiments that were designed to discover the map-based spatial processing of animals. We also predict the results of further experiments.},

We have found that place-specific activity of the neurons was significantly impaired in the GluR-A KO mice. The pyramidal cells in GluR-A KO mice formed firing (place)fields, that were: significantly larger (160-200{\%}), less location selective (73{\%}), less direction selective (39{\%}), less stable (53{\%}) and carried less information about the animal's position (47{\%}) than those cells studied in wild-type mice. Despite the observed positive correlation between the firing field's properties and the degree of cognitive demands of three employed behavioral paradigms, the spatial firing defects were consistent across the paradigms independent from their complexity. We have also found that deletion of the GluR-A gene slightly reduced (5{\%}) the frequency of the hippocampal theta rhythm, but did not affect relative timing of the pyramidal cell spikes in respect to the theta rhythm. These results demonstrate that GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors are necessary for the normal representation of space in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which might be necessary for the flexible working memory system.},

abstract = {The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of CA3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in CA3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in CA3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas.},

abstract = {To act as computational devices, neurons must perform mathematical operations as they transform synaptic and modulatory input into output firing rate. Experiments and theory indicate that neuronal firing typically represents the sum of synaptic inputs, an additive operation, but multiplication of inputs is essential for many computations. Multiplication by a constant produces a change in the slope, or gain, of the input-output relationship, amplifying or scaling down the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input. Such gain modulation occurs in vivo, during contrast invariance of orientation tuning, attentional scaling, translation-invariant object recognition, auditory processing and coordinate transformations. Moreover, theoretical studies highlight the necessity of gain modulation in several of these tasks. Although potential cellular mechanisms for gain modulation have been identified, they often rely on membrane noise and require restrictive conditions to work. Because nonlinear components are used to scale signals in electronics, we examined whether synaptic nonlinearities are involved in neuronal gain modulation. We used synaptic stimulation and the dynamic-clamp technique to investigate gain modulation in granule cells in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Here we show that when excitation is mediated by synapses with short-term depression (STD), neuronal gain is controlled by an inhibitory conductance in a noise-independent manner, allowing driving and modulatory inputs to be multiplied together. The nonlinearity introduced by STD transforms inhibition-mediated additive shifts in the input-output relationship into multiplicative gain changes. When granule cells were driven with bursts of high-frequency mossy fibre input, as observed in vivo, larger inhibition-mediated gain changes were observed, as expected with greater STD. Simulations of synaptic integration in more complex neocortical neurons suggest that STD-based gain modulation can also operate in neurons with large dendritic trees. Our results establish that neurons receiving depressing excitatory inputs can act as powerful multiplicative devices even when integration of postsynaptic conductances is linear. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The hippocampus has a major role in memory for spatial location. Theta is a rhythmic hippocampal EEG oscillation that occurs at approximately 8 Hz during voluntary movement and that may have some role in encoding spatial information. We investigated whether, as part of this process, theta might be influenced by self-movement signals provided by the vestibular system. The effects of bilateral peripheral vestibular lesions, made {\textgreater} or = 60 days prior to recording, were assessed in freely moving rats. Power spectral analysis revealed that theta in the lesioned animals had a lower power and frequency compared with that recorded in the control animals. When the electroencephalography (EEG) was compared in epochs matched for speed of movement and acceleration, theta was less rhythmic in the lesioned group, indicating that the effect was not a result of between-group differences in this behavior. Blood measurements of corticosterone were also similar in the two groups indicating that the results could not be attributed to changes in stress levels. Despite the changes in theta EEG, individual neurons in the CA1 region of lesioned animals continued to fire with a periodicity of approximately 8 Hz. The positive correlation between cell firing rate and movement velocity that is observed in CA1 neurons of normal animals was also maintained in cells recorded from lesion group animals. These findings indicate that although vestibular signals may contribute to theta rhythm generation, velocity-related firing in hippocampal neurons is dependent on nonvestibular signals such as sensory flow, proprioception, or motor efference copy.},

abstract = {A major role of vision is to guide navigation, and navigation is strongly driven by vision (1–4) . Indeed, the brain's visual and navigational systems are known to interact (5,6), and signals related to position in the environment have been suggested to appear as early as in the visual cortex (6,7). Here, to establish the nature of these signals, we recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal area CA1 while mice traversed a corridor in virtual reality. The corridor contained identical visual landmarks in two positions, so that a purely visual neuron would respond similarly at those positions. Most V1 neurons, however, responded solely or more strongly to the landmarks in one position rather than the other. This modulation of visual responses by spatial location was not explained by factors such as running speed. To assess whether the modulation is related to navigational signals and to the animal's subjective estimate of position, we trained the mice to lick for a water reward upon reaching a reward zone in the corridor. Neuronal populations in both CA1 and V1 encoded the animal's position along the corridor, and the errors in their representations were correlated. Moreover, both representations reflected the animal's subjective estimate of position, inferred from the animal's licks, better than its actual position. When animals licked in a given location—whether correctly or incorrectly—neural populations in both V1 and CA1 placed the animal in the reward zone. We conclude that visual responses in V1 are controlled by navigational signals, which are coherent with those encoded in hippocampus and reflect the animal's subjective position. The presence of such navigational signals as early as a primary sensory area suggests that they permeate sensory processing in the cortex.},

abstract = {A minimal synaptic architecture is proposed for how the brain might perform path integration by computing the next internal representation of self-location from the current representation and from the perceived velocity of motion. In the model, a place-cell assembly called a 'chart' contains a two-dimensional attractor set called an 'attractor map' that can be used to represent coordinates in any arbitrary environment, once associative binding has occurred between chart locations and sensory inputs. In hippocampus, there are different spatial relations among place fields in different environments and behavioral contexts. Thus, the same units may participate in many charts, and it is shown that the number of uncorrelated charts that can be encoded in the same recurrent network is potentially quite large. According to this theory, the firing of a given place cell is primarily a cooperative effect of the activity of its neighbors on the currently active chart. Therefore, it is not particularly useful to think of place cells as encoding any particular external object or event. Because of its recurrent connections, hippocampal field CA3 is proposed as a possible location for this 'multichart' architecture; however, other implementations in anatomy would not invalidate the main concepts. The model is implemented numerically both as a network of integrate-and-fire units and as a 'macroscopic' (with respect to the space of states) description of the system, based on a continuous approximation defined by a system of stochastic differential equations. It provides an explanation for a number of hitherto perplexing observations on hippocampal place fields, including doubling, vanishing, reshaping in distorted environments, acquiring directionality in a two-goal shuttling task, rapid formation in a novel environment, and slow rotation after disorientation. The model makes several new predictions about the expected properties of hippocampal place cells and other cells of the proposed network.},

Furthermore, different remapping phenomena have been classified on the basis of how much the tuning changes after different types and degrees of context change, but the relationship between these variables is not clear. We address these ambiguities by formalizing remapping in terms of hidden state inference. According to this view, remapping does not directly reflect objective, observable properties of the environment, but rather subjective beliefs about the hidden state of the environment. We show how the hidden state framework can resolve a number of puzzles about the nature of remapping.},

Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior. These findings demonstrate that multiple hippocampal coding processes for unique types of salient features are distinguished by a Shank2-dependent mechanism and suggest that abnormally distorted hippocampal salience mapping may underlie cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in a subset of ASDs.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells in rats display spatially selective firing in relation to both external and internal cues. In the present study, we assessed the effects of removing visual and/or olfactory cues on place field stability. Place cell activity was recorded as rats searched for randomly scattered food in a cylinder. During an initial recording session, the lights were on and the only available cue was a single white cue card. Following this session, three sessions were run in a row with the cue card removed. In addition, the lights were either turned off or left on and the floor was either cleaned or left unchanged, thus creating four conditions: dark/cleaning, dark/no cleaning, light/cleaning, and light/no cleaning. A fifth session was run with the cue card back on the cylinder wall and the lights turned on. The rat remained in the cylinder during all sessions without being removed at any time. In the dark/cleaning and light/cleaning conditions, most place fields were not stable (i.e., abruptly shifted position). In addition, half of the cells stopped firing in the dark/cleaning condition. In contrast, in the dark/no cleaning and light/no cleaning conditions, most place fields remained stable across sessions. These results suggest that 1) rats are not able to rely on only movement-related information to maintain a stable place representation, 2) visual input is necessary for the firing of a large number of cells, and 3) olfactory information can be used to compensate for the lack of visuospatial information.

abstract = {The discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) permits the characterization of hippocampal computation in much greater detail than previously possible. The present study addresses how an integrate-and-fire unit driven by grid-cell spike trains may transform the multipeaked, spatial firing pattern of grid cells into the single-peaked activity that is typical of hippocampal place cells. Previous studies have shown that in the absence of network interactions, this transformation can succeed only if the place cell receives inputs from grids with overlapping vertices at the location of the place cell's firing field. In our simulations, the selection of these inputs was accomplished by fast Hebbian plasticity alone. The resulting nonlinear process was acutely sensitive to small input variations. Simulations differing only in the exact spike timing of grid cells produced different field locations for the same place cells. Place fields became concentrated in areas that correlated with the initial trajectory of the animal; the introduction of feedback inhibitory cells reduced this bias. These results suggest distinct roles for plasticity of the perforant path synapses and for competition via feedback inhibition in the formation of place fields in a novel environment. Furthermore, they imply that variability in MEC spiking patterns or in the rat's trajectory is sufficient for generating a distinct population code in a novel environment and suggest that recalling this code in a familiar environment involves additional inputs and/or a different mode of operation of the network.

abstract = {Path integration is a straightforward concept with varied connotations that are important to different disciplines concerned with navigation, such as ethology, cognitive science, robotics and neuroscience. In studying the hippocampal formation, it is fruitful to think of path integration as a computation that transforms a sense of motion into a sense of location, continuously integrated with landmark perception. Here, we review experimental evidence that path integration is intimately involved in fundamental properties of place cells and other spatial cells that are thought to support a cognitive abstraction of space in this brain system. We discuss hypotheses about the anatomical and computational origin of path integration in the well-characterized circuits of the rodent limbic system. We highlight how computational frameworks for map-building in robotics and cognitive science alike suggest an essential role for path integration in the creation of a new map in unfamiliar territory, and how this very role can help us make sense of differences in neurophysiological data from novel versus familiar and small versus large environments. Similar computational principles could be at work when the hippocampus builds certain non-spatial representations, such as time intervals or trajectories defined in a sensory stimulus space.},

abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is thought to create and update a dynamical representation of the animal's spatial location. Most suggestive of this process are grid cells, whose firing locations occur periodically in space. Prior studies in small environments were ambiguous as to whether all spatially modulated cells in MEC were variants of grid cells or whether a subset resembled classic place cells of the hippocampus. Recordings from the dorsal and ventral MEC were performed as four rats foraged in a small square box centered inside a larger one. After 6 min, without removing the rat from the enclosure, the walls of the small box were quickly removed, leaving the rat free to continue foraging in the whole area enclosed by the larger box. The rate-responses of most recorded cells (70 out of 93 cells, including 15 of 16 putative interneurons) were considered spatially modulated based on information-theoretic analysis. A number of cells that resembled classic hippocampal place cells in the small box were revealed to be grid cells in the larger box. In contrast, other cells that fired along the boundaries or corners of the small box did not show grid-cell firing in the large box, but instead fired along the corresponding locations of the large box. Remapping of the spatial response in the area corresponding to the small box after the removal of its walls was prominent in most spatially modulated cells. These results show that manipulation of local boundaries can exert a powerful influence on the spatial firing patterns of MEC cells even when the manipulations leave global cues unchanged and allow uninterrupted, self-motion-based localization. Further, they suggest the presence of landmark-related information in MEC, which might prevent cumulative drift of the spatial representation or might reset it to a previously learned configuration in a familiar environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The response of neurons in sensory cortex to repeated stimulus presentations is highly variable. To investigate the nature of this variability, we compared the spike activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats with that of their afferents from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), in response to similar stimuli. We found variability to be much higher in V1 than in LGN. To investigate the sources of the additional variability, we measured the spiking activity of large V1 populations and found that much of the variability was shared across neurons: the variable portion of the responses of one neuron could be well predicted from the summed activity of the rest of the neurons. Variability thus mostly reflected global fluctuations affecting all neurons. The size and prevalence of these fluctuations, both in responses to stimuli and in ongoing activity, depended on cortical state, being larger in synchronized states than in more desynchronized states. Contrary to previous reports, these fluctuations invested the overall population, regardless of preferred orientation. The global fluctuations substantially increased variability in single neurons and correlations among pairs of neurons. Once this effect was removed, pairwise correlations were reduced and were similar regardless of cortical state. These results highlight the importance of cortical state in controlling cortical operation and can help reconcile previous studies, which differed widely in their estimate of neuronal variability and pair wise correlations.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place fields were recorded as rats explored a four-arm radial maze surrounded by curtains holding distal stimuli and with distinct local tactile, olfactory, and visual cues covering each arm. Systematic manipulations of the individual cues and their interrelationships showed that different hippocampal neurons encoded individual local and distal cues, relationships among cues within a stimulus set, and the relationship between the local and distal cues. Double rotation trials, which maintained stimulus relationships within distal and local cue sets, but altered the relationship between them, often changed the responses of the sampled neural population and produced new representations. After repeated double rotation trials, the incidence of new representations increased, and the likelihood of a simple rotation with one of the cue sets diminished. Cue scrambling trials, which altered the topological relationship within the local or distal stimulus set, showed that the cells that followed one set of controlled stimuli responded as often to a single cue as to the constellation. These cells followed the single cue when the stimulus constellation was scrambled, but often continued firing in the same place when the stimulus was removed or switched to respond to other cues. When the maze was surrounded by a new stimulus configuration, all of the cells either developed new place fields or stopped firing, showing that the controlled stimuli had persistent and profound influence over hippocampal neurons. Together, the results show that hippocampal neurons encode a hierarchical representation of environmental information.},

abstract = {Hippocampal place cells show location-specific firing as animals locomote in an environment. A possible explanation for these place fields is that each cell is simply driven by environmental sensory inputs available in its field. This cannot provide the full explanation, however, since cells can maintain stable place fields even in the absence of reliable environmental orienting cues. This suggests the cells are also influenced by movement-related information, since this is the only available, ongoing indicator of current location when external orienting cues are not present. Two candidates for the movement-related information are vestibular activation, and visual motion. To test for these influences, place cells were recorded as animals locomoted in a cylindrical apparatus that was made so that its wall (painted with vertical black and white stripes) and floor could be independently rotated, to provide visual motion and vestibular inputs, respectively. The results showed that both these inputs could influence place fields. Sometimes they caused a predictable locational shift, so that the field rotated its location on the apparatus floor in a way that was compatible with the movement indicated by the vestibular and/or visual motion input. This updating was most reliably obtained when the two inputs were presented in combination. In other cases, the apparatus rotations caused unpredictable changes in firing characteristics, so that cells either stopped firing, or developed place fields that were altered in overall size, shape, and eccentricity. Interestingly, the probability of these changes increased with experience with the rotational manipulations, suggesting a learned component.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation of the $\alpha$-subunit of initiation factor 2 (eIF2) controls protein synthesis by a conserved mechanism. In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2$\alpha$ kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2$\alpha$. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the 'integrated stress response' (ISR). eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC50 = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00498.001.},

abstract = {Path integration was tested in golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, within a new environment and in darkness. From the exit of its home cage, the subject was lured over a certain distance into the experimental arena, and then startled by a sudden noise to induce instantaneous homing. The subjects in experiment 1 had previously been tested within an identical arena in another building; they started the outward journey from a peripheral nest. Upon hearing the sound, all subjects returned in the correct direction to the arena border. In experiments 2 and 3, experimentally na{\"{i}}ve subjects started the outward trip from a central nest exit. Both groups initially oriented correctly, but only a few of subjects returned to the nest. According to computational considerations, experiment 1 required mainly the calculation of the homing direction, while experiments 2 and 3 required a homing vector. Furthermore, the experienced subjects may have been helped by their homing experience in the same type of arena, while the na{\"{i}}ve subjects may not have 'trusted' self-generated vector information sufficiently to follow it to the goal in an uncharted environment.

These deficits persist long after the BVD, and are not simply attributable to ataxia, anxiety, hearing loss or hyperactivity. In tasks such as the foraging task, the spatial memory deficits are evident in darkness when vision is not required to perform the task. The deficits in the radial arm maze, the foraging task and the spatial T maze, in particular, suggest hippocampal dysfunction following BVD, and this is supported by the finding that both hippocampal place cells and theta rhythm are dysfunctional in BVD rats. Now that it is clear that the hippocampus is adversely affected by BVD, the next challenge is to determine what vestibular information is transmitted to it and how that information is used by the hippocampus and the other brain structures with which it interacts.},

abstract = {Studies in both experimental animals and human patients have demonstrated that peripheral vestibular lesions, especially bilateral lesions, are associated with spatial memory impairment that is long-lasting and may even be permanent. Electrophysiological evidence from animals indicates that bilateral vestibular loss causes place cells and theta activity to become dysfunctional; the most recent human evidence suggests that the hippocampus may cause atrophy in patients with bilateral vestibular lesions. Taken together, these studies suggest that self-motion information provided by the vestibular system is important for the development of spatial memory by areas of the brain such as the hippocampus, and when it is lost, spatial memory is impaired. This naturally suggests the converse possibility that activation of the vestibular system may enhance memory. Surprisingly, there is some human evidence that this may be the case. This review considers the relationship between the vestibular system and memory and suggests that the evolutionary age of this primitive sensory system as well as how it detects self-motion (i.e., detection of acceleration vs. velocity) may be the reasons for its unique contribution to spatial memory.},

abstract = {The neural circuitry that controls legged locomotion is exquisitely state dependent. The response to a perturbation at one phase of the locomotor cycle is very different from another. As such, tools that enable closed loop experiments in which freely moving animals can be precisely perturbed, either neurally or mechanically, will improve our ability to probe the locomotor control architecture. Because locomotion emerges from the coupled interaction of the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and physics of the moving body, ideally an experimenter could simultaneously perturb the nervous system, mechanics of the moving animal, or both, at precise moments during well defined locomotor behaviour. Combining the new technique of optogenetics with closed loop tracking of state and fast mechanical perturbations would make this possible. Here we present a computer vision feedback controlled treadmill designed to enable such perturbations. We show that insects (cockroaches Blaberus discoidalis) and mice (Mus mus; C57BL/6) run freely, with preferred speeds in agreement with the literature, over many strides, on the system. We demonstrate the utility of the closed loop system by automatically gathering high speed video (HSV) data when the running animal meets specific operational criteria; here, running within a restricted range of speeds near the midline of the treadmill for a minimum of 2. s. We quantify the mouse's gait from HSV data with a phase-based approach, confirming a normal trotting gait. These results demonstrate the system's potential for dissecting the neuromechanical basis of legged locomotion through closed-loop experimental design. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The hippocampal formation is essential for forming declarative representations of the relationships among multiple stimuli. The rodent hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex and subicular complex, is critical for spatial memory. Two classes of hippocampal neurons fire in relation to spatial features. Place cells collectively map spatial locations, with each cell firing only when the animal occupies that cell's "place field," a particular subregion of the larger environment. Head direction (HD) cells encode directional heading, with each HD cell firing when the rat's head is oriented in that cell's particular "preferred firing direction." Both landmarks and internal cues (e.g., vestibular, motor efference copy) influence place and HD cell activity. However, as is the case for navigation, landmarks are believed to exert greater influence over place and HD cell activity. Here we show that temporary inactivation of the vestibular system led to the disruption of location-specific firing in hippocampal place cells and direction-specific discharge of postsubicular HD cells, without altering motor function. Place and HD cell activity recovered over a time course similar to that of the restoration of vestibular function. These results indicate that vestibular signals provide an important influence over the expression of hippocampal spatial representations, and may explain the navigational deficits of humans with vestibular dysfunction.},

abstract = {The spatial mapping function of the hippocampal formation is likely derived from two sets of information: one based on the external environment and the other based on self-motion. Here, we further characterize 'boundary vector cells' (BVCs) in the rat subiculum, which code space relative to one type of cue in the external environment: boundaries. We find that the majority of cells with fields near the perimeter of a walled environment exhibit an additional firing field when an upright barrier is inserted into the walled environment in a manner predicted by the BVC model. We use this property of field repetition as a heuristic measure to define BVCs, and characterize their spatial and temporal properties. In further tests, we find that subicular BVCs typically treat drop edges similarly to walls, including exhibiting field repetition when additional drop-type boundaries are added to the testing environment. In other words, BVCs treat both kinds of edge as environmental boundaries, despite their dissimilar sensory properties. Finally, we also report the existence of 'boundary-off cells', a new class of boundary-coding cells. These cells fire everywhere except where a given BVC might fire. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

When recorded in freely moving animals, hippocampal pyramidal neurons fire in a location-specific manner: they are "place" cells, comprising a hippocampal representation of the animal's environment. To explore the relationship between place cells and spatial memory, we recorded from mice in several behavioral contexts. We found that long-term stability of place cell firing fields correlates with the degree of attentional demands and that successful spatial task performance was associated with stable place fields. Furthermore, conditions that maximize place field stability greatly increase orientation to novel cues. This suggests that storage and retrieval of place cells is modulated by a top-down cognitive process resembling attention and that place cells are neural correlates of spatial memory. We propose a model whereby attention provides the requisite neuromodulatation to switch short-term homosynaptic plasticity to long-term heterosynaptic plasticity, and we implicate dopamine in this process.},

abstract = {In the absence of useful visual or other exteroceptive cues, rats can orient in their environment using idiothetic navigation, the process in which the information generated during self-motion is integrated to yield a homing vector leading the animal back to a point of departure. If perceivable exteroceptive cues in the visited environment are available, their spatial relationship is integrated with idiothetic information and stored in a cognitive map of the environment. Our previous experiments demonstrated that place navigation in rats is severely impaired after devaluation of the intramaze substratal information by shuffling, i.e. by its random displacement relative to the already traversed track. Several interpretative difficulties of the previous study have been eliminated in the present study by the use of an advanced version of the shuffling apparatus. The results show that shuffling-induced impairment of substratal idiothesis depends on the salience of intramaze cues, that on a stable featureless arena, idiothesis can be updated by non-visual allothetic cues, and that shuffling exposing the animal to sudden accelerations and decelerations interferes with idiothetic navigation by the inherent conflict between substratal and inertial idiothesis. It is concluded that pure substratal idiothesis not updated by extramaze and intramaze cues cannot provide reliable navigation over distances longer than 5 m.},

Both systems allow the animal to compute its position with respect to perceptible landmarks and to the already traversed portion of the path. In the present study, we examined the properties of substratal idiothesis deprived of relevant exteroceptive information. Rats searching for food pellets in an arena formed by a movable inner disk and a peripheral immobile belt were trained in darkness to avoid a 60° sector; rats that entered this sector received a mild foot shock. The punished sector was defined in the substratal idiothetic frame, and the rats had to determine the location of the shock sector with the use of substratal idiothesis only, because all putative intramaze cues were made irrelevant by angular displacements of the disk relative to the belt. Striking impairment of place avoidance by this ''shuffling procedure'' indicates that effective substratal idiothesis must be updated by exteroceptive intramaze cues.},

Whether the brain also represents the same experience as a sequence of discretely segmented events, is unknown. Here, we report a hippocampal CA1 “chunking code”, tracking an episode as its discrete event subdivisions (“chunks”) and the sequential relationships between them. The chunking code is unaffected by unpredicted variations within the events, reflecting the code's flexible nature by being organized around events as abstract units. The chunking code changes accordingly when relationships between events are disrupted or modified. The discrete chunking code and continuous spatial code are represented in the same cells, but in an orthogonal manner, and can be independently perturbed. Optogenetic inactivation of MEC inputs to CA1 disrupts the chunking but not spatial code. The chunking code may be fundamental for representing an episode, alongside codes tracking continuous changes.},

Here, we designed a maze for mice, composed of four materially indistinguishable lap events, and identify hippocampal CA1 neurons whose activity are modulated not only by spatial location but also lap number. These ‘event-specific rate remapping' (ESR) cells remain lap-specific even when the maze length is unpredictably altered within trials, which suggests that ESR cells treat lap events as fundamental units. The activity pattern of ESR cells is reused to represent lap events when the maze geometry is altered from square to circle, which suggests that it helps transfer knowledge between experiences. ESR activity is separately manipulable from spatial activity, and may therefore constitute an independent hippocampal code: an ‘event code' dedicated to organizing experience by events as discrete and transferable units.},

abstract = {The discharge characteristics of postsubicular head-direction cells in a fixed environment were described in the previous paper (Taube et al., 1990). This paper reports changes in the firing properties of head-direction cells following changes in the animal's environment. Head-direction cells were recorded from rats as they moved freely in a 76-cm-diameter gray cylinder. A white card, occupying 100° of arc, was taped to the inside wall of the cylinder and served as the major orienting spatial cue in the animal's environment. Rotation of the cue card produced near-equal rotation in the preferred firing direction of head-direction cells, with minimal changes in peak firing rate, directional firing range, or asymmetry of the firing-rate/head-direction function. Card removal had no effect on peak firing rate or range of firing, but in 8/13 cells the preferred direction rotated by at least 24°. Similarly, changing the shape of the environment to a rectangular or square enclosure caused the preferred firing direction to rotate by at least 48° for 8/10 cells in the rectangle and 3/8 cells in the square, with minimal changes in the peak firing rate or directional firing range. Hand holding the animals and moving them around the cylinder had no effect on the preferred direction or firing range of the cell, but decreased the maximal firing rate in 7/9 cells. On 2 occasions, 2 head-direction cells were recorded simultaneously. The rotation of the preferred firing direction for one cell was the same as the rotation of the preferred direction for the second cell after each environmental manipulation. These results demonstrate that specific visual cues in the environment can exert control over the preferred firing direction and indicate that head-direction cell firing is not a simple sensory response to visual cues, but rather represents more abstract information concerning the animal's spatial relationship with its environment. The constancy of the angle between the preferred firing directions of pairs of simultaneously recorded head-direction cells suggests that there is a fixed mapping of the population onto direction within the environment. Thus, environmental manipulations appear to cause only a change in the reference direction, but leave all other discharge characteristics of directional cells unchanged. In the discussion, comparisons are drawn between the responses of head-direction cells and hippocampal place cells to similar environmental manipulations (Muller and Kubie, 1987), and ways in which these 2 spatial systems interact in navigation are discussed. Our findings show that head-direction cells signal the animal's directional heading within an environment and, as such, would be ideal for serving as part of a navigational system.},

We used immersive virtual reality to decouple visual input from motion-related interoception by manipulating the rotation or translation gain of the visual projection. First, participants walked an outbound path with both visual and interoceptive input, and returned to the start in darkness, demonstrating the influences of both visual and interoceptive information in a virtual reality environment. Next, participants adapted to visual rotation gains in the virtual environment, and then performed the path integration task entirely in darkness. Our findings were accurately predicted by a quantitative model in which visual and interoceptive inputs combine into a single multimodal representation guiding navigation, and are incompatible with a model of separate visual and interoceptive influences on action (in which path integration in darkness must rely solely on interoceptive representations). Overall, our findings suggest that a combined multimodal representation guides large-scale navigation, consistent with a role for visual imagery or a cognitive map.},

So far behavioral paradigms in virtual realities have been limited to linear tracks or open fields. However, little is known whether rodents can learn to navigate in more complex virtual spaces. We used a VR setup with a spherical treadmill but no head-fixation, which permits animals not only to move in a virtual environment but also to freely rotate around their vertical body axis. We trained Mongolian gerbils to perform spatial tasks in virtual mazes of different complexity. Initially the animals learned to run back and forth between the two ends of a virtual linear track for food reward. Performance, measured as path length and running time between the virtual reward locations, improved to asymptotic performance within about five training sessions. When more complex mazes were presented after this training epoch, the animals generalized and explored the new environments already at their first exposure. In a final experiment, the animals also learned to perform a two-alternative forced choice task in a virtual Y-maze. Our data thus shows that gerbils can be trained to solve spatial tasks in virtual mazes and that this behavior can be used as a readout for psychophysical measurements. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, this spatial phase code had an anatomical microstructure within the LS and was bound to the hippocampal spatial code by synchronous gamma frequency cell assemblies. Using a data-driven model, we show that rate-independent spatial tuning arises through the dynamic weighting of CA1 and CA3 cell assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that transformation of the hippocampal spatial map depends on higher-order theta-dependent neuronal sequences. Video Abstract: [Figure presented] How abstract representations are translated into action is unknown. Tingley and Buzs{\'{a}}ki describe how the hippocampal cognitive map is “read out” by a target region. The transformation relies on population coordination referenced to theta oscillations rather than the tuning of individual neurons.},

abstract = {Retrieving and acting on memories of food-predicting environments are fundamental processes for animal survival. Hippocampal pyramidal cells (PYRs) of the mammalian brain provide mnemonic representations of space. Yet the substrates by which these hippocampal representations support memory-guided behavior remain unknown. Here, we uncover a direct connection from dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampus to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that enables the behavioral manifestation of place-reward memories. By monitoring neuronal ensembles in mouse dCA1→NAc pathway, combined with cell-type selective optogenetic manipulations of input-defined postsynaptic neurons, we show that dCA1 PYRs drive NAc medium spiny neurons and orchestrate their spiking activity using feedforward inhibition mediated by dCA1-connected parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. This tripartite cross-circuit motif supports spatial appetitive memory and associated NAc assemblies, being independent of dorsal subiculum and dispensable for both spatial novelty detection and reward seeking. Our findings demonstrate that the dCA1→NAc pathway instantiates a limbic-motor interface for neuronal representations of space to promote effective appetitive behavior. Retrieving and acting on memories of food-predicting environments are fundamental processes for animal survival. Trouche et al. show in mice that the behavioral manifestation of spatial appetitive memory requires a direct neural pathway from dorsal hippocampus to nucleus accumbens. This pathway engages dCA1 with a select population of accumbens parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons, thereby sculpting the assembly activity of its postsynaptic medium-sized spiny neurons. An indirect pathway through dorsal subiculum is dispensable for appetitive memory but contributes to spatial novelty detection.},

Here we show in freely foraging rats that temporal information is robustly encoded across time scales from seconds to hours within the overall population state of the lateral entorhinal cortex. Similarly pronounced encoding of time was not present in the medial entorhinal cortex or in hippocampal areas CA3–CA1. When animals' experiences were constrained by behavioural tasks to become similar across repeated trials, the encoding of temporal flow across trials was reduced, whereas the encoding of time relative to the start of trials was improved. The findings suggest that populations of lateral entorhinal cortex neurons represent time inherently through the encoding of experience. This representation of episodic time may be integrated with spatial inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex in the hippocampus, allowing the hippocampus to store a unified representation of what, where and when.},

abstract = {Adaptive behavior requires the ability to analyze experience both prospectively and retrospectively. How can forward-ordered neural activity facilitate the storage or expression of reverse-ordered sequences? Wang et al. used multitetrode recordings from many individual hippocampal CA1 neurons in rats while simultaneously recording field potentials expressing theta oscillations. Spatial representation in the place cell network oscillated between forward and backward sweeps within each theta oscillation. Backward replay was associated with theta peaks, whereas forward replay was associated with theta troughs. Most cells fell into one category, but some corresponding to deep-layer neurons showed bimodular responses. Backward replay was driven by entorhinal inputs, whereas forward replay was evoked by CA3 inputs. These are important insights into the underlying basis of coding future and past experiences.

Science , this issue p. [247][1]

Neural networks display the ability to transform forward-ordered activity patterns into reverse-ordered, retrospective sequences. The mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. We discovered that, during active navigation, rat hippocampal CA1 place cell ensembles are inherently organized to produce independent forward- and reverse-ordered sequences within individual theta oscillations. This finding may provide a circuit-level basis for retrospective evaluation and storage during ongoing behavior. Theta phase procession arose in a minority of place cells, many of which displayed two preferred firing phases in theta oscillations and preferentially participated in reverse replay during subsequent rest. These findings reveal an unexpected aspect of theta-based hippocampal encoding and provide a biological mechanism to support the expression of reverse-ordered sequences.

We recorded grid cells while rats were trained in two rectangular compartments, A and B (each 1 m × 2 m), separated by a wall. Once distinct grid maps were established in each environment, we removed the partition and allowed the rat to explore the merged environment (2 m × 2 m). The grid patterns were largely retained along the distal walls of the box. Nearer the former partition line, individual grid fields changed location, resulting almost immediately in local spatial periodicity and continuity between the two original maps. Grid cells belonging to the same grid module retained phase relationships during the transformation. Thus, when environments are merged, grid fields reorganize rapidly to establish spatial periodicity in the area where the environments meet.},

abstract = {Allothetic and idiothetic navigation strategies rely on very different cues and computational procedures. Allothetic navigation uses the relationships between external cues (visual, auditory, and olfactory) and mapping or geometrical calculations to locate places. Idiothetic navigation relies on cues generated by self-movement (proprioceptive cues or cues from optic, auditory, and olfactory flow, or efference copy of motor commands) and path integration to locate a present location and/or a starting point. Whereas it is theorized that exploratory behavior is used by animals to create a central representation of allothetic cues, it is unclear whether exploration plays a role in idiothetic navigation. Computational models suggest that either a reference frame, calibrated by exploration, or vector addition, without reference to exploration, could support path integration. The present study evaluated the contribution of exploration in these navigation strategies by comparing its contribution to the solution of both allothetic and idiothetic navigation problems. In two experiments, rats were trained to forage on an open table for large food pellets, which they then carried to a refuge to eat. Once trained, they were given probe trials from novel locations in either normal light, which permits the use of allothetic cues, or in infrared light, which requires the use of idiothetic cues. When faced with a new problem in either lighting condition, the rats first explored the foraging table before navigating directly home with the food. That exploration is equally important for allothetic and idiothetic navigation, suggests that both navigation strategies require a calibrated representation of the environment.

We propose medial entorhinal cells form a basis describing structural knowledge, and hippocampal cells link this basis with sensory representations. Adopting these principles, we introduce the Tolman-Eichenbaum machine (TEM). After learning, TEM entorhinal cells display diverse properties resembling apparently bespoke spatial responses, such as grid, band, border, and object-vector cells. TEM hippocampal cells include place and landmark cells that remap between environments. Crucially, TEM also aligns with empirically recorded representations in complex non-spatial tasks. TEM also generates predictions that hippocampal remapping is not random as previously believed; rather, structural knowledge is preserved across environments. We confirm this structural transfer over remapping in simultaneously recorded place and grid cells.},

Several studies have explored the age-related deficit in spatial information processing by recording the location-specific activity of hippocampal neurons (place cells). However, these studies have generated disparate characterizations of place cells in aged rats as unstable (Barnes et al., 1997), resistant to change (Tanila et al., 1997b; Oler and Markus, 2000; Wilson et al., 2003), or delayed in using external cues (Rosenzweig et al., 2003). To reconcile these findings, we recorded place cells from aged and young rats as they repeatedly explored both a highly familiar environment and an initially novel environment, and we repeatedly tested whether the place fields formed in the novel environment were anchored by external cues. Initially, spatial representations in aged rats were abnormally maintained between the familiar and novel environments. Then, new representations were formed but were also delayed in becoming anchored to the external landmarks. Finally, even when the new spatial representations became bound to the landmarks, they were multi-stable across repetitive exposures to the formerly novel environment. These observations help to reconcile previously divergent characterizations of spatial representation in aged rats and suggest a model of cognitive aging and hippocampal function.},

Ants have been shown to merge the directional information available from their path integration (PI) and visual memory, but as yet it is not clear that they do so in a way that reflects the relative certainty of the cues. In this study, we manipulate the variance of the PI home vector by allowing ants (Cataglyphis velox) to run different distances and testing their directional choice when the PI vector direction is put in competition with visual memory. Ants show progressively stronger weighting of their PI direction as PI length increases. The weighting is quantitatively predicted by modelling the expected directional variance of home vectors of different lengths and assuming optimal cue integration. However, a subsequent experiment suggests ants may not actually compute an internal estimate of the PI certainty, but are using the PI home vector length as a proxy.},

We have developed an optogenetic strategy to identify functionally defined cell types in the MEC that project directly to the hippocampus. By expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in the hippocampus-projecting subset of entorhinal projection neurons, we were able to use light-evoked discharge as an instrument to determine whether specific entorhinal cell groups--such as grid cells, border cells and head-direction cells--have direct hippocampal projections. Photoinduced firing was observed at fixed minimal latencies in all functional cell categories, with grid cells as the most abundant hippocampus-projecting spatial cell type. We discuss how photoexcitation experiments can be used to distinguish the subset of hippocampus-projecting entorhinal neurons from neurons that are activated indirectly through the network. The functional breadth of entorhinal input implied by this analysis opens up the potential for rich dynamic interactions between place cells in the hippocampus and different functional cell types in the entorhinal cortex (EC).},

abstract = {Effective spatial navigation is enabled by reliable reference cues that derive from sensory information from the external environment, as well as from internal sources such as the vestibular system. The integration of information from these sources enables dead reckoning in the form of path integration. Navigation in the dark is associated with the accumulation of errors in terms of perception of allocentric position and this may relate to error accumulation in path integration. We assessed this by recording from place cells in the dark under circumstances where spatial sensory cues were suppressed. Spatial information content, spatial coherence, place field size, and peak and infield firing rates decreased whereas sparsity increased following exploration in the dark compared to the light. Nonetheless it was observed that place field stability in darkness was sustained by border information in a subset of place cells. To examine the impact of encountering the environment's border on navigation, we analyzed the trajectory and spiking data gathered during navigation in the dark. Our data suggest that although error accumulation in path integration drives place field drift in darkness, under circumstances where border contact is possible, this information is integrated to enable retention of spatial representations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zhang, Sch{\"{o}}nfeld, Wiskott and Manahan-Vaughan.},

abstract = {As animals navigate, they must identify features within context. In the mammalian brain, the hippocampus has the ability to separately encode different environmental contexts, even when they share some prominent features. To do so, neurons respond to sensory features in a context-dependent manner; however, it is not known how this encoding emerges. To examine this, we performed electrical recordings in the hippocampus as mice navigated in two distinct virtual environments. In CA1, both synaptic input to single neurons and population activity strongly tracked visual cues in one environment, whereas responses were almost completely absent when the same cue was presented in a second environment. A very similar, highly context-dependent pattern of cue-driven spiking was also observed in CA3. These results indicate that CA1 inherits a complex spatial code from upstream regions, including CA3, that have already computed a context-dependent representation of environmental features.},

In addition pretests in reading comprehension, word reading and vocabulary were administered. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to investigate to what extent reading modality would influence the students' scores on the reading comprehension measure. Conclusion: Main findings show that students who read texts in print scored significantly better on the reading comprehension test than students who read the texts digitally.

Although the groups did not differ in performance on a test of spatial memory, or on their ability to remember the location of individual words in a text, the good comprehenders were better at remembering the order in which specific words appeared in a text.

In the second part, many of the topics are discussed that are typically found in a cognitive psychology text.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The modeling is based on spiking neurons with spike-frequency adaptation. Adaptation causes the continuing evolution in the pattern of neural activity that is essential to mental exploration. A successful mental exploration is remembered through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. The system is also an episodic memory for an animal chiefly concerned with locations.},

    abstract = { AbstractNavigation first requires accurate perception of one's spatial orientation within the environment, which consists of knowledge about location and directional heading. Cells within several limbic system areas of the mammalian brain discharge allocentrically as a function of the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's location and ongoing behavior. These cells are referred to as head direction (HD) cells and are believed to encode the animal's perceived directional heading with respect to its environment. Although HD cells are found in several areas, the principal circuit for generating this signal originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus and projects serially, with some reciprocal connections, to the lateral mammillary nucleus → anterodorsal thalamus → PoS, and terminates in the entorhinal cortex. HD cells receive multimodal information about landmarks and self-generated movements. Vestibular information appears critical for generating the directional signal, but motor/proprioceptive and landmark information are important for updating it. }

The functionally determined position, size, and shape of area 17 corresponded precisely to the location of this area as seen in stained cortical sections. The retinotopic map, which was confirmed with electrophysiological recordings, exhibited very low inter-animal variability, thus allowing averaging of maps across animals. Patches of activity in area 17 were often encircled by regions in which the intrinsic signal dropped below baseline, suggesting the presence of strong surround inhibition. Single-unit recordings revealed that this decrease of the intrinsic signal indeed correlated with a drop of neuronal firing rate below baseline. The averaged maps also greatly facilitated the identification of extrastriate visual activity, pointing to at least four extrastriate visual areas in the mouse. We conclude that optical imaging is ideally suited to visualize retinotopic maps in mice, thus making this a powerful technique for the analysis of map structure in transgenic animals.},

In contrast, there has been controversy over whether the hippocampus mediates a similarly general memory function in other species, or whether it is dedicated to spatial memory processing3,4,5,6. Evidence for the spatial view is derived principally from the observations of ‘place cells'—hippocampal neurons that fire whenever the animal is in a particular location in its environment7,8, or when it perceives a specific stimulus or performs a specific behaviour in a particular place3,4. We trained rats to perform the same recognition memory task in several distinct locations in a rich spatial environment and found that the activity of many hippocampal neurons was related consistently to perceptual, behavioural or cognitive events, regardless of the location where these events occurred. These results indicate that non-spatial events are fundamental elements of hippocampal representation, and support the view that, across species, the hippocampus has a broad role in information processing associated with memory.},

abstract = {The observation of hippocampal place cells forms a major line of evidence supporting  the view that the hippocampus is dedicated to spatial processing. However, most studies demonstrating the spatial properties of hippocampal unit activity have employed tasks that emphasize spatial cues but minimize nonspatial cues. In the present experiment we recorded the activity of hippocampal complex-spike cells from rats performing a nonspatial radial maze task. Performance in this task was guided by local visual-tactile cues on the maze arms, while distal spatial cues were minimized and made irrelevant. The influence of three variables on unit activity was examined:type of cue on an arm, spatial location of an arm, and the relative position of the animal on an arm. Of the units recorded, almost one-fifth were classified as "cue cells" in that their activity was associated with cue type but not spatial location. Conversely, a similar proportion of the units were classified as "place cells" in that their activity was associated with location, but not cue type. In an additional similar proportion of units, firing was influenced only by relative position and not by local cues or spatial locations. For the majority of units, however, firing was related to combinations of these three variables, indicating that most hippocampal neurons encoded conjunctions or relations between spatial and local cue information. This pattern of results indicates that when local rather than distal spatial cues are emphasized, hippocampal neural activity is strongly influenced by salient nonspatial cues and shows no overwhelming predominance of place coding. These findings are at odds with the hypothesis that the hippocampus is selectively involved in spatial processing and, conversely, support the broader view that the hippocampus encodes both spatial and nonspatial relations among important experimental variables.},

Further analyses revealed significant lever position firing biases in approximately 70{\%} of the cells tested irrespective of subtype. The complexity of firing correlates of the neurons recorded in this DMTS task suggests that the hippocampus divides specific aspects of the performance demands of the task across different cell subtypes, which together provide sufficient information to resolve the matching-to-sample problem on any given trial.},

We studied the formation of new place representations in rats by examining the changes in place-specific firing of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the relationship between these changes and behavioral change across multiple days of exposure to novel places. We found that many neurons showed very rapid changes on the first day of exposure to the novel place, including many cases in which a previously silent neuron developed a place field over the course of a single pass through the environment. Across the population, the largest changes in neural activity occurred on day 2 of exposure to a novel place, but only if the animal had little experience (\&lt;4 min) in that location on day 1. Longer exposures on day 1 were associated with smaller changes on day 2, suggesting that hippocampal neurons required 5-6 min of experience to form a stable spatial representation. Even after the representation stabilized, the animals{\textquoteright} behavior remained different in the novel places, suggesting that other brain regions continued to distinguish novel from familiar locations. These results show that the hippocampus can form new spatial representations quickly but that stable hippocampal representations are not sufficient for a place to be treated as familiar.},

abstract = {Some theories of memory propose that the hippocampus integrates the individual items  and events of experience within a contextual or spatial framework. The hippocampus receives cortical input from two major pathways: the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). During exploration in an open field, the firing fields of MEC grid cells form a periodically repeating, triangular array. In contrast, LEC neurons show little spatial selectivity, and it has been proposed that the LEC may provide non-spatial input to the hippocampus. Here, we recorded MEC and LEC neurons while rats explored an open field that contained discrete objects. LEC cells fired selectively at locations relative to the objects, whereas MEC cells were weakly influenced by the objects. These results provide the first direct demonstration of a double dissociation between LEC and MEC inputs to the hippocampus under conditions of exploration typically used to study hippocampal place cells.},

abstract = {Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their  primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroencephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7-12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100 degrees to 355 degrees in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

abstract = {Determined whether the model for storage and recall of sequence information (O. Jensen and J. E. Lisman, see record 84-24910) can account for some key results regarding hippocampal place cells (PCs). It is shown that the phase advance can be understood if it is assumed that the hippocampus is in a recall mode that operates when a rat is already familiar with a path. In this mode, sensory information about the current position triggers recall of the upcoming 5–6 places in the path at a rate of 1 memory per gamma cycle. The model predicts that the average phase advance will be 1 gamma cycle per theta cycle. The model also accounts for the fact that the firing of a PC occurs during ≈7 theta cycles (on average) as a rat crosses the place field; the observation that the phase of PC firing depends more systematically on position than on time; and the fact that traversal of an already familiar path produces further modifications. This later finding suggests that recall of previously stored information strengthens the memory of that information. The general success of the model provides support for the idea that the hippocampus stores sequence information and makes predictions of expected positions during gamma-frequency recall.

abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce ([1993] Hippocampus 68:317-330) have observed that the spatially  selective firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus tends to advance to earlier phases of the electroencephalogram theta rhythm as a rat passes through the place field of a cell. We present here a neural network model based on integrate- and-fire neurons that accounts for this effect. In this model, place selectivity in the hippocampus is a consequence of synaptic interactions between pyramidal neurons together with weakly selective external input. The phase shift of neuronal spiking arises in the model as result of asymmetric spread of activation through the network, caused by asymmetry in the synaptic interactions. Several experimentally observed properties of the phase shift effect follow naturally from the model, including 1) the observation that the first spikes a cell fires appear near the theta phase corresponding to minimal population activity, 2) the overall advance is less than 360 degrees, and 3) the location of the rat within the place field of the cell is the primary correlate of the firing phase, not the time the rat has been in the field. The model makes several predictions concerning the emergence of place fields during the earliest stages of exploration in a novel environment. It also suggests new experiments that could provide further constraints on a possible explanation of the phase precession effect.},

	abstract = {The firing rate of hippocampal neurons in rats was related both to spatial location and to multiple behavioral variables as rats performed 2 kinds of tasks that rely on hippocampal function: a spatial navigation task similar in performance demands to the radial-arm maze task and a simultaneous cue odor-discrimination task. In the place task, most cells had distinct single or multiple place fields, that is, neurons increased firing when the rat was in a particular location or locations. However, in most of these cells, firing rate also varied systematically in relation to behavioral variables, including the speed, direction, and turning angle of the rat as it moved through the place field. In addition, the activity of most cells was time-locked to task-relevant approach movements. In the odor task, most cells fired as the rat sampled discriminative cues or when it executed specific, task- relevant approach movements. Some cells fired selectively in relation to which odors were presented, the configuration of odor cues, the locus of the response, or a combination of these variables. Many cells with spatial correlates in the place task also had striking behavioral correlates when rats performed the odor task in the same environment, and the locus of the increased firing associated with behavior in the odor task was not the same as the place field in the place task. Thus, while the complex stimuli that compose spatial cues are reflected in hippocampal neuronal activity, hippocampal processing is not limited to the representation of spatial location. Rather, the domain of hippocampal representation includes both spatial and nonspatial relations among multiple cues and the actions directed in relation to these cues, across cue modalities, and across behavioral paradigms.},

abstract = {Previous studies have identified neurons in the postsubiculum which discharge as a  function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of its behavior and location in the environment. Anatomical studies have shown that the postsubiculum contains reciprocal connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). In order to determine how the head direction (HD) cell signal is processed in the brain, single-unit recordings were monitored in the ATN of freely moving rats in order to characterize their behavioral and spatial correlates. Animals were trained to retrieve food pellets thrown randomly into a cylindrical apparatus containing a single orientation cue. Single unit recordings in the ATN showed that approximately 60{\%} of the recorded cells discharged in relation to the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane. Observation of the animal and quantitative analyses showed that HD cell firing was not dependent on the animal's behavior, trunk position, linear speed, angular head velocity, or location in the environment. Most of these cells were localized to the anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus. Each HD cell contained only one head direction at which the cell discharged maximally and the firing rate decreased linearly away from this preferred direction. The preferred firing directions from all cells recorded were distributed over a 360 degrees range. Quantitative analysis showed that these cells contained similar discharge parameters (peak firing rate, directional firing range) to values reported previously for postsubicular HD cells (Taube et al., 1990a). Experiments involving rotation of the orientation cue showed that the preferred firing direction could be controlled by a salient visual cue. In contrast to postsubicular HD cells, passive rotation of a restrained animal showed that most ATN HD cells ceased discharging when the animal's head was oriented in the preferred direction. These findings demonstrate the presence of HD cells in the ATN and indicate the potential importance of this area for spatial navigation. The origin of the head direction signal is discussed and it is concluded that because of the presence of reciprocal connections between the postsubiculum and the ATN, further studies are required in order to determine the direction in which this head-directional information is flowing. Finally, ATN HD cells differ from postsubicular HD cells by appearing to require volitional motoric input.},

abstract = {Hippocampal "place cells" fire when a freely moving rat is in a given location. The  firing of these cells is controlled by visual and nonvisual environmental cues. The effects of darkness on the firing of place cells was studied using the task of Muller et al. (1987), in which rats were trained to chase randomly scattered food pellets in a cylindrical drum with a white cue-card attached to the wall. The position of the rats was tracked via an infrared LED on the headstage with a video system linked to computer. Two experimental protocols were used: in the first, lights were turned off after the rat had already been placed in the chamber; in the second, the rat was placed in the darkened chamber. The dark segments produced by these 2 methods were identical with respect to light and other cues but differed with respect to the rat's experience. The firing patterns of 24 of 28 cells were unaffected by darkness when it was preceded by a light period. In contrast, the firing patterns of 14 of 22 cells changed dramatically when the rats were put into the darkened chamber. Furthermore, the majority of cells that changed their firing pattern in initial darkness maintained that change when the lights were turned on. These results show that place cells can fire differently in identical cue situations and that the best predictor of firing pattern is a combination of current cues and the rat's recent experience. The results are discussed in terms of mnemonic properties of hippocampal cells and "remapping" of place cell representations.},

We regularly experience the effect when watching television and movies, where the voices seem to emanate from the actors' lips rather than from the actual sound source. Originally, ventriloquism was explained by performers projecting sound to their puppets by special techniques, but more recently it is assumed that ventriloquism results from vision "capturing" sound. In this study we investigate spatial localization of audio-visual stimuli. When visual localization is good, vision does indeed dominate and capture sound. However, for severely blurred visual stimuli (that are poorly localized), the reverse holds: sound captures vision. For less blurred stimuli, neither sense dominates and perception follows the mean position. Precision of bimodal localization is usually better than either the visual or the auditory unimodal presentation. All the results are well explained not by one sense capturing the other, but by a simple model of optimal combination of visual and auditory information.},

abstract = {An optimal linear system for integrating visual cues to 3D surface geometry weights  cues in inverse proportion to their uncertainty. The problem of integrating texture and stereo information for judgments of planar surface slant provides a strong test of optimality in human perception. Since the accuracy of slant from texture judgments changes by an order of magnitude from low to high slants, optimality predicts corresponding changes in cue weights as a function of surface slant. Furthermore, since humans show significant individual differences in their abilities to use both texture and stereo information for judgments of 3D surface geometry, the problem admits the stronger test that individual differences in subjects' thresholds for discriminating slant from the individual cues should predict individual differences in cue weights. We tested both predictions by measuring slant discrimination thresholds and stereo/texture cue weights as a function of surface slant for multiple subjects. The results bear out both predictions of optimality, with the exception of an apparent slight under-weighting of texture information. This may be accounted for by factors specific to the stimuli used to isolate stereo information in the experiments. Taken together, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that humans optimally combine the two cues to surface slant, with cue weights proportional to the subjective reliability of the cues.},

abstract = {How does the visual system combine information from different depth cues to estimate  three-dimensional scene parameters? We tested a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) model of cue combination for perspective (texture) and binocular disparity cues to surface slant. By factoring the reliability of each cue into the combination process, MLE provides more reliable estimates of slant than would be available from either cue alone. We measured the reliability of each cue in isolation across a range of slants and distances using a slant-discrimination task. The reliability of the texture cue increases as |slant| increases and does not change with distance. The reliability of the disparity cue decreases as distance increases and varies with slant in a way that also depends on viewing distance. The trends in the single-cue data can be understood in terms of the information available in the retinal images and issues related to solving the binocular correspondence problem. To test the MLE model, we measured perceived slant of two-cue stimuli when disparity and texture were in conflict and the reliability of slant estimation when both cues were available. Results from the two-cue study indicate, consistent with the MLE model, that observers weight each cue according to its relative reliability: Disparity weight decreased as distance and |slant| increased. We also observed the expected improvement in slant estimation when both cues were available. With few discrepancies, our data indicate that observers combine cues in a statistically optimal fashion and thereby reduce the variance of slant estimates below that which could be achieved from either cue alone. These results are consistent with other studies that quantitatively examined the MLE model of cue combination. Thus, there is a growing empirical consensus that MLE provides a good quantitative account of cue combination and that sensory information is used in a manner that maximizes the precision of perceptual estimates.},

abstract = {How do people combine their sense of direction with their use of visual landmarks  during navigation? Cue-integration theory predicts that such cues will be optimally integrated to reduce variability, whereas cue-competition theory predicts that one cue will dominate the response direction. We tested these theories by measuring both accuracy and variability in a homing task while manipulating information about path integration and visual landmarks. We found that the two cues were near-optimally integrated to reduce variability, even when landmarks were shifted up to 90°. Yet the homing direction was dominated by a single cue, which switched from landmarks to path integration when landmark shifts were greater than 90°. These findings suggest that cue integration and cue competition govern different aspects of the homing response: Cues are integrated to reduce response variability but compete to determine the response direction. The results are remarkably similar to data on animal navigation, which implies that visual landmarks reset the orientation, but not the precision, of the path-integration system.},

abstract = {This project investigated the ways in which visual cues and bodily cues from  self-motion are combined in spatial navigation. Participants completed a homing task in an immersive virtual environment. In Experiments 1A and 1B, the reliability of visual cues and self-motion cues was manipulated independently and within-participants. Results showed that participants weighted visual cues and self-motion cues based on their relative reliability and integrated these two cue types optimally or near-optimally according to Bayesian principles under most conditions. In Experiment 2, the stability of visual cues was manipulated across trials. Results indicated that cue instability affected cue weights indirectly by influencing cue reliability. Experiment 3 was designed to mislead participants about cue reliability by providing distorted feedback on the accuracy of their performance. Participants received feedback that their performance with visual cues was better and that their performance with self-motion cues was worse than it actually was or received the inverse feedback. Positive feedback on the accuracy of performance with a given cue improved the relative precision of performance with that cue. Bayesian principles still held for the most part. Experiment 4 examined the relations among the variability of performance, rated confidence in performance, cue weights, and spatial abilities. Participants took part in the homing task over two days and rated confidence in their performance after every trial. Cue relative confidence and cue relative reliability had unique contributions to observed cue weights. The variability of performance was less stable than rated confidence over time. Participants with higher mental rotation scores performed relatively better with self-motion cues than visual cues. Across all four experiments, consistent correlations were found between observed weights assigned to cues and relative reliability of cues, demonstrating that the cue-weighting process followed Bayesian principles. Results also pointed to the important role of subjective evaluation of performance in the cue-weighting process and led to a new conceptualization of cue reliability in human spatial navigation.},

abstract = "Path integration has long been thought of as an obligatory process that automatically updates one’s position and orientation during navigation. This has led to the hypotheses that path integration serves as a back-up system in case landmark navigation fails, and a reference system that detects discrepant landmarks. Three experiments tested these hypotheses in humans, using a homing task with a catch-trial paradigm. Contrary to the back-up system hypothesis, when stable landmarks unexpectedly disappeared on catch trials, participants were completely disoriented, and only then began to rely on path integration in subsequent trials (Experiment 1). Contrary to the reference system hypothesis, when stable landmarks unexpectedly shifted by 115° on catch trials, participants failed to detect the shift and were completely captured by the landmarks (Experiment 2). Conversely, when chronically unstable landmarks unexpectedly remained in place on catch trials, participants failed to notice and continued to navigate by path integration (Experiment 3). In the latter two cases, they gradually sensed the instability (or stability) of landmarks on later catch trials. These results demonstrate that path integration does not automatically serve as a back-up system, and does not function as a reference system on individual sorties, although it may contribute to monitoring environmental stability over time. Rather than being automatic, the roles of path integration and landmark navigation are thus dynamically modulated by the environmental context."

abstract = {Anatomical connectivity and recent neurophysiological results imply that grid cells  in the medial entorhinal cortex are the principal cortical inputs to place cells in the hippocampus. The authors propose a model in which place fields of hippocampal pyramidal cells are formed by linear summation of appropriately weighted inputs from entorhinal grid cells. Single confined place fields could be formed by summing input from a modest number (10-50) of grid cells with relatively similar grid phases, diverse grid orientations, and a biologically plausible range of grid spacings. When the spatial phase variation in the grid-cell input was higher, multiple, and irregularly spaced firing fields were formed. These observations point to a number of possible constraints in the organization of functional connections between grid cells and place cells.},

Mean body length (125.4 mm), tail length (95.5 mm) and body weight (53.6 g) was lower in WILD, although no other external characteristics were obviously different. Related allometrically to net carcass weight, organ weights were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.01) in LAB (brain – 17.6{\%}, eyes – 26.0{\%}, heart – 22.3{\%}, lungs – 43.3{\%}). Seizures frequently seen in LAB were absent in WILD trapped (n = 167) or subsequently housed in Germany (n = 81), and rare in their offspring. Mean litter size was greater in LAB (n = 5.5) than in WILD bred in the laboratory (n = 4.4). The WILD breeding strain was named Ugoe:MU95. A genetic bottleneck (n = 9) that occurred in 1954 and remarkably smaller brains in LAB indicate that the laboratory strain has become domesticated and should be designated as “Laboratory gerbils” (M. unguiculatus forma domestica) to signify this new case of domestication among rodents.},

It combines high-quality histological material for identification of brain structures with reliable stereotaxic coordinates. The atlas consists of high-resolution images of frontal sections alternately stained for cell bodies (Nissl) and myelinated fibers (Gallyas) of 62 rostro-caudal levels at intervals of 350 $\mu$m. Brain structures were named according to the Paxinos nomenclature for rodents. The accuracy of the stereotaxic coordinate system was improved substantially by comparing and matching the series of histological sections to in vivo brain images of the gerbil obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The skull outlines corresponding to the MR images were acquired using X-ray computerized tomography (CT) and were used to establish the relationship between coordinates of brain structures and skull. Landmarks such as lambda, bregma, ear canals and occipital crest can be used to line up skull and brain in standard atlas coordinates. An easily reproducible protocol allows sectioning of experimental brains in the standard frontal plane of the atlas.},

abstract = {This study investigated the spatial distribution and cellular-synaptic generation of  hippocampal sharp waves (SPW) in the dorsal hippocampus of the awake rat. Depth analyses of SPWs were performed by stepping the recording electrode in 82.5 microns increments. SPWs were present during slow wave sleep, awake immobility, drinking, grooming and eating (0.01-2/s). The largest negative SPWs were recorded from the middle part of the stratum radiatum of CA1, the stratum lucidum of CA3, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and from layer I of the subiculum, in that order. The polarity of the SPWs was positive in layers II-IV of the subiculum, in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3, and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The electrical gradients across the null zones of the field SPWs were as large as 8-14 mV/mm. SPWs were associated with population bursts of pyramidal cells and increased discharges of interneurons and granule cells. During the SPW the excitability of granule cells and pyramidal cells to afferent volleys increased considerably. Picrotoxin and atropine and aspiration lesion of the fimbria-fornix increased either the amplitude or the frequency of SPWs. Diazepam and Nembutal could completely abolish SPWs. It is suggested that: hippocampal SPWs are triggered by a population burst of CA3 pyramidal cells as a result of temporary disinhibition from afferent control; and field SPWs represent summed extracellular PSPs of CA1 and subicular pyramidal cells, and dentate granular cells induced by the Schaffer collaterals and the associational fibers of hilar cells, respectively. The relevance of the physiological SPWs to epileptic interictal spikes and long-term potentiation is discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on  the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. APPROACH: We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. MAIN RESULTS: In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. SIGNIFICANCE: The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.},

We describe two measures of unit isolation quality, Lratio and Isolation Distance, and evaluate their performance using simulations and tetrode recordings. Both measures quantified how well separated the spikes of one cluster (putative neuron) were from other spikes recorded simultaneously on the same multi-channel electrode. In simulations and tetrode recordings, both Lratio and Isolation Distance discriminated well- and poorly-separated clusters. In data sets from the rodent hippocampus in which neurons were simultaneously recorded intracellularly and extracellularly, values of Isolation Distance and Lratio were related to the correct identification of spikes.},

abstract = {A number of computational models of hippocampal place cells incorporate attractor neural network architecture to simulate key findings in the place cell literature, including the properties of pattern completion, firing in the absence of visual input, and nonlinear responses to environmental manipulations. To test for evidence of attractor dynamics, ensembles of place cells were recorded using multiple-tetrode techniques. After many days of experience in an environment with salient local surface cues on a circular track and salient distal landmarks on the wall, the local surface cues were rotated as a set in opposition to the distal landmarks. The amount of mismatch between the local and distal sets of cues varied from 45 to 1800. If place cells were parts of strong attractors, then their place fields should follow either the local cues or the distal cues as an integrated ensemble. Instead, in single recording sessions, some place cells were controlled by the distal landmarks, other cells were controlled by the local cues, and other cells became silent or gained new fields. In some cases, individual place fields split in half, following both the local and distal cues. If place cells are indeed parts of attractor networks in the hippocampus, then the attractors may be weak relative to the inputs from external sources, such as representations of the sensory environment and representations of heading direction, in a familiar, well explored environment.},

This so-called path integration system (dead reckoning) allows the animal to return to its home, or to a familiar feeding place, even when external cues are absent or novel. However, without the use of external cues, the path integration process leads to rapid accumulation of errors involving both the direction and distance of the goal. Therefore, even nocturnal species such as hamsters and mice rely more on previously learned visual references than on the path integration system when the two types of information are in conflict.

The later discovery of head direction cells, grid cells and border cells, as well as of cells with more complex spatial signals, has led to the idea that there is a brain system devoted to providing the animal with the information required to achieve efficient navigation. Current questioning is focused on how these signals are integrated in the brain. In this review, we focus on the issue of how self-localization is performed in the hippocampal place cell map. To do so, we first shortly review the sensory information used by place cells and then explain how this sensory information can lead to two coding modes, respectively based on external landmarks (allothetic information) and self-motion cues (idiothetic information). We hypothesize that these two modes can be used concomitantly with the rat shifting from one mode to the other during its spatial displacements. We then speculate that sequential reactivation of place cells could participate in the resetting of self-localization under specific circumstances and in learning a new environment. Finally, we provide some predictions aimed at testing specific aspects of the proposed ideas.},

Here, we investigate the possible contributions of these cell types to place cell firing, taking advantage of a developmental time window during which stable border cell, but not grid cell, inputs are available. We find that before weaning, the place cell representation of space is denser, more stable, and more accurate close to environmental boundaries. Boundary-responsive neurons such as border cells may, therefore, contribute to stable and accurate place fields in pre-weanling rats. By contrast, place cells become equally stable and accurate throughout the environment after weaning and in adulthood. This developmental switch in place cell accuracy coincides with the emergence of the grid cell network in the entorhinal cortex, raising the possibility that grid cells contribute to stable place fields when an organism is far from environmental boundaries.},

We found that new, highly distinct configurations of place fields emerged immediately and remained stable during the septal inactivation. The new place code persisted when theta oscillations had recovered.

However, cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal area CA3 of the rodent typically display place fields, where individual cells are active over only a single portion of the space. In a model of the hippocampus, we have shown that the connectivity from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate granule cells could allow the dentate granule cells to operate as a competitive network to recode their inputs to produce sparse orthogonal representations, and this includes spatial pattern separation. In this paper we show that the same computational hypothesis can account for the mapping of EC grid cells to dentate place cells. We show that the learning in the competitive network is an important part of the way in which the mapping can be achieved. We further show that incorporation of a short term memory trace into the associative learning can help to produce the relatively broad place fields found in the hippocampus.},

These cells are thought to provide an efficient metric for navigation in large-scale space [5-8]. However, an accurate and universal metric requires grid cell firing patterns to uniformly cover the space to be navigated, in contrast to recent demonstrations that environmental features such as boundaries can distort [9-11] and fragment [12] grid patterns. To establish whether grid firing is determined by local environmental cues, or provides a coherent global representation, we recorded mEC grid cells in rats foraging in an environment containing two perceptually identical compartments connected via a corridor. During initial exposures to the multicompartment environment, grid firing patterns were dominated by local environmental cues, replicating between the two compartments. However, with prolonged experience, grid cell firing patterns formed a single, continuous representation that spanned both compartments. Thus, we provide the first evidence that in a complex environment, grid cell firing can form the coherent global pattern necessary for them to act as a metric capable of supporting large-scale spatial navigation.},

This process is highly context-dependent and crucial for perceptual performances such as decision-making and sensory object formation. Yet despite its fundamental ecological role, voluntary self-motion is rarely incorporated in perceptual or neurophysiological investigations of sensory processing in animals. Here, we present the Sensory Island Task (SIT), a new freely moving search paradigm to study sensory processing and perception. In SIT, animals explore an open-field arena to find a sensory target relying solely on changes in the presented stimulus, which is controlled by closed-loop position tracking in real-time. Within a few sessions, animals are trained via positive reinforcement to search for a particular area in the arena (“target island”), which triggers the presentation of the target stimulus. The location of the target island is randomized across trials, making the modulated stimulus feature the only informative cue for task completion. Animals report detection of the target stimulus by remaining within the island for a defined time (“sit-time”). Multiple “non-target” islands can be incorporated to test psychometric discrimination and identification performance. We exemplify the suitability of SIT for rodents (Mongolian gerbil, Meriones unguiculatus) and small primates (mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus) and for studying various sensory perceptual performances (auditory frequency discrimination, sound source localization, visual orientation discrimination). Furthermore, we show that pairing SIT with chronic electrophysiological recordings allows revealing neuronal signatures of sensory processing under ecologically relevant conditions during goal-oriented behavior. In conclusion, SIT represents a flexible and easily implementable behavioral paradigm for mammals that combines self-motion and natural exploratory behavior to study sensory sensitivity and decision-making and their underlying neuronal processing.},
